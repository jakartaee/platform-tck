TCK Coverage Document for JSR-245: JavaServer Pages 3.1 Specification and
Expression Language 5.0 Specification

The Expression Language 3.1 Specification is incorporated by reference in
the JavaServer Pages 5.0 Specification.

TCK Components:
---------------
- User's Guide
- Compatibility Rules
- Configuration Instructions
- Test Suite
- API Tests 
- Signature Tests
- End-to-End Tests
- Framework Code
- JavaTest TM Harness

Terminology of Metrics
----------------------
- Assertion: A specific statement of functionality or behavior derived from a specification.
  A testable assertion is one that can be validated in an implementation by testing.
- Test: A binary application (or script) comprised of one or more Test Cases.
- Test Case: A single set of test inputs, execution conditions, and expected results
  developed to verify an implementation's conformance with a specific assertion.
- Specification Assertion Coverage: Ratio of all assertions tested by at least one test
  case to the total number of testable assertions defined by the specification.
- API Coverage: Ratio of methods directly exercised by test cases to the total number
  of methods defined by the specification.


Coverage
--------
- Total testable assertions from the JavaServer Pages 3.1 Specification,
  Expression Language 5.1 Specification, and Javadoc:

     883 specification assertions
  +  451 API assertions
  ----------------------
    1334 testable assertions

- Number of testable Jakarta Server Pages Spec assertions tested: 546 (61.83%)
- Number of testable Jakarta Server Pages API assertions tested:  370 (82.04%)

- Total of 68.67% combined specification and api coverage.

Assertions were identified through the use of CTS Tools and hand markup (hand markup was
required for the Jakarta Server Pages and Expression Language specifications)


Quality Assurance
-----------------
- TCK was run using representative configurations of the Reference Implementation on
  the following platforms:
   * Ubuntu 12.10
   * Fedora 18
   * openSUSE 12.2
   * Solaris 11.1 Sparc
   * Solaris 11.1 X86
   * Solaris 10 Sparc
   * MacOS 10.8
   * Oracle Linux Server release 6.3
   * Windows XP Professional
   * Windows 2008

Justification of Adequacy
-------------------------
The Jakarta Server Pages and Expression Language tests, distributed as part 
of the JavaEE CTS version 7, provides an adequate set of tests to ensure all
implementations of the Java EE 7 Platform are compatible with the requirements
defined in these specifications.  As with all TCKs it is impossible to provide tests
that will yield 100% assertion coverage. Untested assertions are due to the effects
of late specification changes, and the availability and cost of test development resources.
While these versions may not have tests for all testable assertions, all implementations of 
the platform must be compatible with the requirements defined in these specifications.
