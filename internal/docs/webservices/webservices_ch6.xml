                            The handler chain file in the jakarta.jws.HandlerChain annotation is required to be packaged in the module. It must follow the requirements for location as specified in section 4.6.1 of JSR-181 specification (Web Services Metadata for the Java Platform).

                            Additionally, the handler chain file can also be packaged and specified in the annotation such that, it is accessible as a resource from the ClassPath.

                            At runtime, container providers must first try to access the handler chain file as per the locations specified in JSR-181 specification. Failing that, they must try to access it as a resource from the ClassPath.

                   In a JAX-WS based container, a Handler chain is processed according to the JAX-WS specification section
                   9.2.1.2. In addition to this, the ordering of any given type of Handler (logical or protocol) in the 
                   deployment descriptor must be maintained.

                   A JAX-WS based container must carry out any injections (if any) requested by the handler, typically via
                   the @Resource annotation (see section 2.2 of JSR-250 Common Annotations for Java Platform specification).
