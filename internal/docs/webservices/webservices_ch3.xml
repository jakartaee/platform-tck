Web Service.
A service implementation implements the methods of an interface that is describable by WSDL. The methods are implemented using a Stateless/Singleton Session EJB or JAX-RPC/JAX-WS web component. Add support for Singleton Session EJB.

Web Service Components.
The second uses a constrained implementation of a stateless session EJB or Singleton(only for JAX-WS services) in the EJB container. Add support for Singleton Session EJB.

Support for Java EE profiles.
The Java EE 6 platform specification introduces "profiles" to target specific class of applications.

The Java EE 6 platform marks JAX-RPC as a proposed optional technology that may be pruned in a future release. Therefore, requirements in this specification related to JAX-RPC should also be considered proposed optional. Such requirements may be made optional in a future release of this specification.

This specification gives choices for the vendors that want to support only certain containers for JAX-WS web services. A JSR-109 implementation must support at least one of the following configurations for JAX-WS web services:

   1. JAX-WS web component in a Servlet container
   2. Stateless or Singleton Session EJB as JAX-WS web service
