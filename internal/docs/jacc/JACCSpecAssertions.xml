			<description>A policy context is in one of three states and all
implementations of the PolicyConfiguration interface must implement the state
semantics defined in this section.

- open
A policy context in the open state must be available for configuration by any
of the methods of the PolicyConfiguration interface. A policy context in the
open state must not be assimilated at Policy.refresh into the policy statements
used by the Policy provider in performing its access decisions.

- inService
A policy context in the inService state must be assimilated at Policy.refresh
into the policy statements used by its provider. When a provider's refresh
method is called, it must assimilate only policy contexts that are in the inService
state and it must ensure that the policy statements put into service for
each policy context are only those defined in the context at the time of the call
to refresh. A policy context in the inService state must be unavailable for
additional configuration. A policy context in the inService state must be transitioned
to the open state when it is returned as a result of a call to getPolicy-
Configuration. A policy context is transitioned to the inService state by
calling the commit method, and only a policy context in the open state may be
transitioned to the inService state.

-  deleted
A policy context in the deleted state must be unavailable for configuration and
it must be unavailable for assimilation into its associated Provider. A policy
context in the deleted state must be transitioned to the open state when it is
returned as a result of a call to getPolicyConfiguration. A policy context is
transitioned to the deleted state by calling the delete method.

			<description>A WebUserDataPermission must be instantiated for each distinct combination
of url-pattern and acceptable connection type resulting from the processing
of the security-constraint elements that do not contain an excluding
auth-constraint. The mapping of security-constraint to acceptable
connection type must be as defined in Mapping Transport Guarantee to Connection
Type. Each WebUserDataPermission object must be constructed using the
qualified pattern as its name and with actions defined by appending a
representation of the acceptable connection type to the union of the HTTP
methods named or implied by the collections containing the pattern and occurring
in a security-constraint that maps to the connection type and that does not
contain an excluding auth-constraint. The resulting permissions must be
added to the unchecked policy statements by calling the
addToUncheckedPolicy method on the PolicyConfiguration object.

Containers that chose to provide this functionality must satisfy the following
requirements.
To associate an application or module with an existing set of linked policy
contexts, the identifiers of the existing policy contexts must be applied by the
relevant containers in fulfilling their obligations as defined in the Policy Decision
and Enforcement Subcontract. The policy contexts should be verified for
existence, by calling the inService method of the
PolicyConfigurationFactory of the Policy providers of the relevant
containers. The deployment tools must call Policy.refresh on the Policy
provider of each of the relevant containers, and the containers must not accept
requests for the deployed resources until these calls have completed.

			<description>Containers
that chose to provide this functionality must satisfy the following requirements.

To ensure redeployment does not create a situation where the removal of
policy statements on application components renders what were protected
components unprotected, the application server must stop accepting requests for
the application's components before redeployment begins. The application server
must not resume processing requests for the application's components until after
the calls to Policy.refresh, described below, have completed.

To redeploy a module, the deployment tools must indicate at all of the Policy
providers to which the module is to be redeployed that the policy context
associated with the module is to be removed from service. If the module is to be
redeployed to the same policy context at a provider, all policy statements must be
removed from the policy context at the provider. 

After the policy contexts have been marked for removal from service and emptied of policy statements (as
necessary), the deployment tools must translate the declarative authorization
policy appearing in the module's deployment descriptor into PolicyConfiguration
objects within the Policy providers at which the module is being redeployed.

 After the translation, the PolicyConfiguration objects must be linked, as
necessary, to the policy context of every other module in the same provider with
which the module must share the same principal-to-role mappings. 

After the module is linked, the commit method must be called on the
PolicyConfiguration objects. After commit has been called, a call must be
made to Policy.refresh on the Policy provider used by each of the containers
to which the module has been redeployed.

			<description>The Servlet container must construct (or reuse) a WebUserDataPermission object
using the request URI minus the context path as the name and with actions
composed from the HTTP method of the request and a protection value describing
the transport layer protection of the connection on which the request arrived. 
The protection value used in the permission construction must be
determined as follows:
 - If the request arrived on a connection deemed by the container to be protected
for confidentiality, a protection value of :CONFIDENTIAL must be used.
- If the request arrived on a connection deemed by the container to be protected
for integrity (but not confidentiality), a protection value of :INTEGRAL must be used.
-  If the request arrived on a connection deemed by the container to be unprotected,
   the actions used in the permission construction must contain only the HTTP
   method of the request.

The Servlet container must use one of the methods described in Section 4.7,
Checking AccessControlContext Independent Grants to test if access to the
resource using the method and connection type encapsulated in the
WebUserDataPermission is permitted. If a SecurityException is thrown in the
permission determination, it must be caught, and the result of the determination
must be that access to the resource using the method and connection type is not
permitted. If access is not permitted, the request must be redirected as defined by
the Servlet Specification. If access is permitted, the request must be subjected to a
pre-dispatch decision.

			<description> A container must use one of the following techniques to check an instance of a 
permission for which policy is defined independent of AccessControlContext.

- The container calls AccessControlContext.checkPermission with
the permission being checked as argument. The call to checkPermission
may be made on any AccessControlContext. If checkPermission throws
an AccessControlException, the permission is not granted. Otherwise the
permission is granted.

- The container calls AccessController.checkPermission with the
permission being checked. The value of the current thread?s
AccessControlContext is irrelevant in the access determination. If
checkPermission throws an AccessControlException, the checked
permission is not granted. Otherwise the permission is not granted.

- The container calls SecurityManager.checkPermission with the
permission being checked. If checkPermission throws an
AccessControlException, the checked permission is not granted. Otherwise the
permission is granted.

- The container calls Policy.implies with two arguments; the
permission being checked and a ProtectionDomain that need not be
constructed with principals. The checked permission is granted if
Policy.implies returns true. Otherwise, the permission is not granted.

- The container calls
java.security.Policy.getPermissions with a ProtectionDomain
that need not be constructed with principals. The container must call the
implies method on the returned PermissionCollection using the permission
being checked as argument. The checked permission is granted if the
PermissionCollection implies it. Otherwise, the permission is not granted. This
technique is supported but not recommended.

Prior to using any of the techniques described in this section, the container
must have established a policy context identifier as defined in Section 4.6,
Setting the Policy Context.

			<description>A container must determine if the caller has been granted a permission by
evaluating the permission in the context of an AccessControlContext,
ProtectionDomain, or Subject containing the principals of (only) the caller. If the
caller's identity has been asserted or vouched for by a trusted authority (other than
the caller), the principals of the authority must not be included in the principals of
the caller.A container must use one of the following techniques to determine if a
permission has been granted to the caller.

The container calls AccessControlContext.checkPermission with
the permission as argument. The call to checkPermission must be made on
an AccessControlContext that contains the principals of the caller. If
checkPermission throws an AccessControlException, the permission is not
granted to the caller. Otherwise the permission is granted.

The container calls AccessController.checkPermission with the
permission as argument. The AccessControlContext associated with the thread
on which the call to checkPermission is made must contain the principals
of the caller. If checkPermission throws an AccessControlException, the
permission is not granted to the caller. Otherwise the permission is granted.

The container calls SecurityManager.checkPermission with the
permission as argument. The AccessControlContext associated with the thread
on which the call to checkPermission is made must contain the principals
of the caller. If checkPermission throws an AccessControlException, the
permission is not granted to the caller. Otherwise the permission is granted.

The container calls Policy.implies with two arguments; the
permission being checked and a ProtectionDomain constructed with the
principals of the caller. The boolean result returned by Policy.implies
indicates whether or not the permission has been granted to the caller.

The container calls
java.security.Policy.getPermissions with an argument
ProtectionDomain that was constructed with the principals of the caller. The
container must call the implies method on the returned
PermissionCollection using the permission being checked as argument. If the
PermissionCollection implies the permission being tested, the permission has
been granted to the caller. Otherwise it has not. This technique is supported but
not recommended.

			<description>A Policy provider must use the combined policy statements of the default policy
context (as defined in Section 4.10, Default Policy Context) and of the policy
context identified by calling PolicyContext.getContextID to determine if they
imply the permission being checked. If one or more excluded policy statements
imply the checked permission, the evaluation may terminate and the checked
permission must be determined not to be granted. Otherwise, if one or more
unchecked policy statements imply the checked permission, the checked
permission must be determined to be granted independent of
AccessControlContext. If the status of the checked permission is not resolved by
the excluded and unchecked evaluations, it must be determined if a permission
that implies the checked permission has been granted to the
AccessControlContext being tested for the permission. The checked permission
may only be determined to be granted if a permission that implies the checked
permission has been granted to the AccessControlContext. Otherwise the
permission must be determined not to be granted.

			<description>The WebResourcePermission and WebUserDataPermission objects resulting
from the translation of a Servlet deployment descriptor must be constructed with
name produced by qualifying the URL pattern. The rules for qualifying a URL
pattern are dependent on the rules for determining if one URL pattern matches
another as defined in Section 3.1.3.3, Servlet URL-Pattern Matching Rules, and
are described as follows:

-  If the pattern is a path prefix pattern, it must be qualified by every path-prefix
pattern in the deployment descriptor matched by and different from the pattern
being qualified. The pattern must also be qualified by every exact pattern
appearing in the deployment descriptor that is matched by the pattern being
qualified.

-  If the pattern is an extension pattern, it must be qualified by every path-prefix
pattern appearing in the deployment descriptor and every exact pattern in the
deployment descriptor that is matched by the pattern being qualified.

-  If the pattern is the default pattern, "/", it must be qualified by every other pattern
except the default pattern appearing in the deployment descriptor.

- If the pattern is an exact pattern, its qualified form must not contain any qualifying
patterns.

URL patterns are qualified by appending to their String representation, a
colon separated representation of the list of patterns that qualify the pattern.
Duplicates must not be included in the list of qualifying patterns, and any
qualifying pattern matched by another qualifying pattern may be dropped from
the list.
QualifyingPatternList ::=
      empty string | colon QualifyingPattern |
      QualifyingPatternList colon QualifyingPattern
 QualifiedPattern ::= Pattern QualifyingPatternList

Any pattern, qualified by a pattern that matches it, is overridden and made
irrelevant (in the translation) by the qualifying pattern. Specifically, all extension
patterns and the default pattern are made irrelevant by the presence of the path
prefix pattern "/*" in a deployment descriptor. Patterns qualified by the "/*"
pattern violate the URLPatternSpec constraints of WebResourcePermission and
WebUserDataPermission names and must be rejected by the corresponding
permission constructors.

"/*") and the other pattern starts with the substring of this pattern, minus its
last 2 characters, and the next character of the other pattern, if there is one, is
"/", or
-  this pattern is an extension pattern (that is, it starts with "*.") and the other
pattern ends with this pattern, or

            The following list defines changes to this contract that 
              apply to containers running without a Java SE SecurityManager. 
 
                  1. The restrictions defined in Section 3.3,  Permission to 
                     Configure Policy need not be enforced. Also, the 
                     containers of the application server must not be 
                     denied permission to perform any operation that would 
                     have been permitted in the presence of a SecurityManager. 

                  2. Such containers are not required (before dispatching a 
                     call) to associate an AccessControlContext with the call 
                     thread (as otherwise required by Section 4.1.3,  
                     Pre-dispatch Decision and Section 4.3.1,  
                     EJB Pre-dispatch Decision). 

                  3. When performing the operations defined in Section 4.7,  
                     Checking AccessControlContext Independent Grants and in 
                     Section 4.8,  Checking the Caller for a Permission, 
                     such containers must not employ the 
                     SecurityManager.checkPermission and 
                     AccessControlContext.checkPermission techniques defined 
                     in these sections.

               Independent of this specification, Jakarta EE deployment tools must translate and complete the declarative policy
               statements appearing in deployment descriptors into a form suitable for securing applications on the platform. 
               These deployment tools must combine policy annotations in Java code with policy statements appearing in deployment
               descriptors to yield complete representations of authorization policy suitable for securing applications on the platform. 
               The rules for combining authorization policy annotations with declarative policy statements are described in the 
               Jakarta Enterprise Beans, Jakarta Servlet, and Jakarta EE platform specifications. Independent of whether annotations 
               factor in the translation, the resulting policy statements may differ in form from the policy statements appearing 
               in the deployment descriptors.

             Permission Names for Transport and Pre-Dispatch Decisions 
            The name of the permission checked in a transport or pre-dispatch 
       decision must be the value that would result from applying the Servlet 
       welcome file processing rules to the unqualified request URI minus the 
       context path. 
  
            For the special case where this transformation of the request URI 
       yields the URLPattern /, the empty string URLPattern, , must be 
       used as the permission name. The welcome file processing rules are 
       defined in the Servlet specification. For the special case where the 
       empty string must be substituted for the / pattern in the permission 
       evaluation, all target related processing (including servlet mapping, 
       filter mapping, and form based login processing) must be performed 
       using the original pattern, /.
