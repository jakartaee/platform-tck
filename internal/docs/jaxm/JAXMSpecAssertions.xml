			<description>A JAXM implementation must handle both one-way (asynchronous) and request-response (synchronous) styles of messaging.

The container may be either a Servlet 2.2/2.3 container or a J2EE 1.3 container. A JAXM client is either connected to a JAXM messaging provider in an (asynchronous) one-way style of interaction or is connected directly to a JAXM service (using a URL) in a (synchronous) request-response style of interaction.</description>

			<description>Given that JAXM supports both one-way and request-response forms of messaging, the Endpoint object has been modeled such that it must be specified explicitly on the call method of the SOAPConnection object. By contrast, the send method of the ProviderConnection object does not allow for the specification of an Endpoint object because there is an assumption that one-way messaging is inherently asynchronous, this requiring self-addressed (that is, profiled) messages. The URLEndpoint object is a direct subclass of the Endpoint object class. JAXM clients wishing to contact a SOAP based service in a point-to-point, request-response (that is, synchronous) manner, may choose to do so without utilizing the services of a JAXM provider. A URLEndpoint object contains a URL that is passed to the call method to send a SOAP message to a SOAP service and block while waiting for a response from the service.</description>

			<description>The ProviderConnection and ProviderConnectionFactory objects must be used when a JAXM application requires one-way (asynchronous) messaging semantics. JAXM clients that choose to use the services of a JAXM messaging provider must create a ProviderConnection object that connects the application to the JAXM provider. JAXM clients may create a default ProviderConnectionFactory object by using the newInstance() method.</description>

			<description>A JAXM service must implement either the OnewayListener or the ReqRespListener marker interface. The OnewayListener interface is intended for services that are implemented to use a one-way, asynchronous style of messaging. The ReqRespListener interface is intended for services that are implemented to use a request-response, synchronous style of messaging.</description>

			<description>The JAXMServlet class is a utility class that provides the support for the two types of listener interfaces for a JAXM service deployed in a Servlet 2.2/2.3 container. A developer will simply extend this class to define and create a JAXM service and will implement the specific listener interface whether performing asynchronous one-way or synchronous request-response type messaging.</description>
