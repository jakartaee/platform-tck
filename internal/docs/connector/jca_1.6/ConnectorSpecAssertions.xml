                     - If a MessageEndpointFactory implementation (such as support for Message

                       Inflow requirements specified in Chapter 13, "Message Inflow" must be

                       distributed XA transactions is provided by the standalone connector 
                       container implementation, the standalone implementation must support

                    Standalone container test.
                    Also, this is not required to be supported by all standalone containers so
                    is being flagged as optional.
                    There was much discussion about using keywords to test this and while it is
                    simple enough to implement - it goes against the intended use of keywords 
                    in CTS so will not provide an optional test for this.

                     - (RA) - submit parent work to appserver where parent work might

                       submit a child work obj to AppServer where child has SIC("barUser")

			This should be testable for our case but there is some concern that

                        thus we can NOT test in a compatible manner since there is no

                   After discussions with Spec Lead, it was deemed that this is likely not
                   testable.
                   This exact type check in isContextSupported enables a resource adapter 
                   to decide if the application server supports the contexts that it wants 
                   to establish for a Work instance. If a particular WorkContext class is 
                   not supported by the application server a resource adapter may then, 
                   either choose to fallback to a superclass that is supported by the app
                   server (again ascertained via the isContextSupported method) or fail Work 
                   submission.

                    The application server must employ a java.lang.Class.isAssignable(

                    server, can be converted to the type provided by the resource adapter, 
                    via an identity conversion or via a widening reference conversion.

                    The TransactionContext class extends the ExecutionContext class (
                    see Section 10.3.5 "ExecutionContext Class" ). It represents the standard interface a
                    resource adapter can use to propagate transaction context information from the EIS
                    to the application server. The Work instance and any message deliveries to
                    MessageEndpoints in that Work instance must all be carried out in the context of

                            This statement changed from jca 1.5 to 1.6.  It used to state the following in jca 1.5:
                            "An ActivationSpec JavaBean must not override the default java.lang.Object.equals 
                             method. This ensures that each ActivationSpec JavaBean is treated uniquely (based

                            To test: You can have two MDBs using the same activation spec (but different
                            configuration properties defined in the DD of the MDBs) and the RAR
                            should not be receiving same instance of Activation Spec during

                    A resource adapter may use the CallerPrincipalCallback to set the

                    establish the argument Principal as the caller principal associated with the
                    invocation being processed by the container. When the argument Principal is

                    A resource adapter might use the GroupPrincipalCallback to establish the

                    establish the container's representation of no group principals within the Subject.
                    Otherwise, the handler's processing of this callback is additive, yielding the
                    union (without duplicates) of the principals existing within the Subject, and
                    those created with the names occuring within the argument array. The

                   provide a JavaBean that implements the ResourceAdapter interface. The resource

                    To test, ActivationSpec in this case need to implement ResourceAdapterAssociation.
                    So during instantiation of ActivationSpec, connector container will call
                    this method which ActivationSpec can cache and use it.
                      eg:
                           MyActivationSpec implements ResourceAdaperAssociation {
                               void setResourceAdapter(ResourceAdapter ra) throws ResourceException{
                                 this.ra = ra;
                               }
                               ResourceAdapter getResourceAdapter() throws ResourceException{
                                 return this.ra;
                               }
                           }
                           So, a test can check whether RA instance indeed available for the
                           activation spec after instantiation.

                   this should be related to class loading and should be easy to 
                   test as the test for this should already be here.  it should be
                   possible to add a resource-ref to test...

                  If an application references an extension using the Extension Mechanism
                  Architecture (See Section EE.8.2 "Library Support" of "JavaTM Platform,
                  Enterprise Edition (Java EE) Specification, version 6" on page F-1) and a jar file
                  within a standalone resource adapter supplies that extension, the standalone
                  resource adapter must be made available to the application.

                   -This is a valid test that should be added though it will likely 
                    cause issues for many vendors as it appears to be an area that may
                    not have been supported.  it may be one of those areas that slipped
                    by many folks so we should look to add a test here.
                   -Additionally, this is using JavaSE extension mechanism and similar
                    to asserton 300 in concept. (refer to JavaSE extension architecture)
