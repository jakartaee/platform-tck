An implementation MUST NOT use application-provided threads to deliver callbacks, e.g. by borrowing them when the application invokes a remote operation.

Errors that occur during the invocation are reported when the client attempts to retrieve the results of the operation.

Dynamic case.

create(URL wsdlLocation, QName serviceName, WebServiceFeature ... features) Returns a service object for the specified WSDL document and service name. The created service needs to be configured with the web service features.

create(QName serviceName, WebServiceFeature ... features) Returns a service object for a service with the given name. No WSDL document is attached to the service. The created service needs to be configured with the web service features.

    * Conformance (Service creation using features): The created service object must honor the web service features. If a JAX-WS implementation doesn't understand any passed-in feature, it must throw WebServiceException.

Static case.

When starting from a WSDL document, a concrete service implementation class MUST be generated as defined in section 2.7. The generated implementation class MUST have all the public constructors as shown in the example below.

When using the constructors, the default WSDL location and service name are implicitly taken from the WebServiceClient annotation that decorates the generated class.

The following code snippet shows the generated constructors:

// Generated Service Class

@WebServiceClient(name="StockQuoteService",
                  targetNamespace="http://example.com/stocks",
                  wsdlLocation="http://example.com/stocks.wsdl")
public class StockQuoteService extends javax.xml.ws.Service {
  public StockQuoteService() {
    super(new URL("http://example.com/stocks.wsdl"),
          new QName("http://example.com/stocks", "StockQuoteService"));
  }

  public StockQuoteService(WebServiceFeature ... features) {
    super(new URL("http://example.com/stocks.wsdl"),
          new QName("http://example.com/stocks", "StockQuoteService"),
	  features);
  }

  public StockQuoteService(URL wsdlLocation) {
    super(wsdlLocation,
          new QName("http://example.com/stocks", "StockQuoteService"));
  }

  public StockQuoteService(URL wsdlLocation, WebServiceFeature ... features) {
    super(wsdlLocation,
          new QName("http://example.com/stocks", "StockQuoteService"),
	  features);
  }

  public StockQuoteService(URL wsdlLocation, QName serviceName) {
    super(wsdlLocation, serviceName);
  }

  public StockQuoteService(URL wsdlLocation, QName serviceName, WebServiceFeature ... features) {
    super(wsdlLocation, serviceName, features);
  }

  ...
}

javax.xml.ws.BindingProvider

    * Conformance (BindingProvider's W3CEndpointReference): The returned W3CEndpointReference MUST contain wsam:ServiceName and wsam:ServiceName[@EndpointName] as per Addressing 1.0 - Metadata[35]. The wsam:InterfaceName MAY be present in the W3CEndpointReference. If there is an associated WSDL, then the WSDL location MUST be referenced using wsdli:wsdlLocation in the W3CEndpointReference's wsa:Metadata.

Proxies.
Proxy instances are not guaranteed to be thread safe. If the instances are
accessed by multiple threads, usual synchronization techniques can be used to support multiple threads.

The use of WS-Addressing requirements can be indicated in a WSDL as per Addressing 1.0 - Metadata[35]. A proxy created using getPort() calls is configured with the addressing requirements as specified in the associated WSDL or explicitly passing javax.xml.ws.soap.AddressingFeature web service feature.
    * Conformance (Proxy's Addressing use): A proxy MUST be configured with the use of addressing requirements as indicated in the associated WSDL. But if the proxy is created using javax.xml.ws.soap.AddressingFeature web service feature, the feature's addressing requirements MUST take precedence over WSDL's addressing requirements.
