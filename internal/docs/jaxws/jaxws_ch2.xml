			<description>Message parts are either listed or unlisted. If the value of a wsdl:part elements name attribute is present in the parameterOrder attribute then the part is listed, otherwise it is unlisted.  Parameters that are mapped from message parts are either listed or unlisted. Parameters that are mapped from listed parts are listed; parameters that are mapped from unlisted parts are unlisted. 
Parameters that are mapped from wrapper children (wrapper style mapping only) are unlisted. 
Listed parameters appear first in the method signature in the order in which their corresponding parts 
are listed in the parameterOrder attribute. 
Unlisted parameters either form the return type or follow the listed parameters 
The return type is determined as follows: 
Non-wrapper style mapping Only parameters that are mapped from parts in the abstract output message 
may form the return type, parts from other messages (see e.g. section 2.6.2.1) do not qualify. If
there is a single unlisted out part in the abstract output message then it forms the method 
return type, otherwise the return type is void. 
Wrapper style mapping If there is a single out wrapper child then it forms the method return type, 
if there is an out wrapper child with a local name of return then it forms the method return 
type, otherwise the return type is void. 
Unlisted parameters that do not form the return type follow the listed parameters in the following 
order: 
1. Parameters mapped from in and in/out parts appear in the same order the corresponding parts 
appear in the input message. 
2. Parameters mapped from in and in/out wrapper children (wrapper style mapping only) appear 
in the same order as the corresponding elements appear in the wrapper.
