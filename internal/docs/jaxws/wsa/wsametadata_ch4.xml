        Default Action Pattern for WSDL 1.1 -
A default pattern is also defined for backwards compatibility with WSDL 1.1. In the absence of the wsam:Action attribute, the following patterns are used to construct a default action for inputs, outputs, and faults. The general form of an action IRI is defined using the following terms:

[delimiter]

    is ":" when the [target namespace] is a URN, otherwise "/". Note that for IRI schemes other than URNs which aren't path-based (i.e. those that outlaw the "/" character), the default action value might not conform to the rules of the IRI scheme. Authors are advised to specify explicit values in the WSDL in this case.
"Fault"

    is a literal character string to be included in the action.
[target namespace]

    is the target namespace (/definition/@targetNamespace). If [target namespace] ends with a "/" an additional "/" is not added.
[port type name]

    is the name of the port type (/definition/portType/@name).
[input|output name]

    is the name of the element as defined in Section 2.4.5 of WSDL 1.1.
[fault name]

    is the name of the fault (/definition/porttype/operation/fault/@name).
