			<description>When a client receives a message the mandatory JMS-defined message property JMSXDeliveryCount will be set to the number of times the message has been delivered. The first time a message is received it will be set to 1, so a value of 2 or more means the message has been redelivered. If the JMSRedelivered message header value is set then the JMSXDeliveryCount property must always be 2 or more. See section 3.4.7 "JMSRedelivered" for more information about the JMSRedelivered message header. The purpose of the JMSXDeliveryCount property is to allow consuming applications to identify whether a particular message is being repeatedly redelivered and take appropriate action. The value of the JMSXDeliveryCount property is not guaranteed to be exactly correct. The JMS provider is not expected to persist this value to ensure that its value is not lost in the event of a failure.</description>

			<description>JMS provides five forms of message body. Each form is defined by a message interface: " StreamMessage - a message whose body contains a stream of Java primitive values. It is filled and read sequentially. " MapMessage - a message whose body contains a set of name-value pairs where names are Strings and values are Java primitive types. The entries can be accessed sequentially by enumerator or randomly by name. The order of the entries is undefined. " TextMessage - a message whose body contains a java.lang.String. The inclusion of this message type is based on our presumption that String messages will be used extensively. One reason for this is that XML will likely become a popular mechanism for representing the content of JMS messages. " ObjectMessage - a message that contains a Serializable Java object. If a collection of Java objects is needed, one of the collection classes provided in JDK 1.2 can be used. " BytesMessage - a message that contains a stream of uninterpreted bytes. This message type is for literally encoding a body to match an existing message format. In many cases, it will be possible to use one of the other, self-defining, message types instead. Although JMS allows the use of message properties with byte messages, they are typically not used, since the inclusion of properties may affect the format.</description>

Since such clients cannot know for certain if a particular message has been acknowledged, they must be prepared for redelivery of the last consumed message.

			<description>Clients may alternatively use the following methods which return immediately and use a separate thread to send the message and, if necessary, wait for a confirmation message back from the JMS server: send(Destination destination, Message message, CompletionListener completionListener) send(Destination destination, Message message, int deliveryMode, int priority, long timeToLive, CompletionListener completionListener) send(Message message, CompletionListener completionListener) send(Message message, int deliveryMode, int priority, long timeToLive, CompletionListener completionListener). When the message has been successfully sent the JMS provider invokes the callback method onCompletion on an application-specified CompletionListener object. Only when that callback has been invoked can the application be sure that the message has been successfully sent with the same degree of confidence as if a normal synchronous send had been performed. An application which requires this degree of confidence must therefore wait for the callback to be invoked before continuing.
The following information is intended to give an indication of how an asynchronous send would typically be implemented.
In some JMS providers, a normal synchronous send involves sending the message to a remote JMS server and then waiting for an acknowledgement to be received before returning. It is expected that such a provider would implement an asynchronous send by sending the message to the remote JMS server and then returning without waiting for an acknowledgement. When the acknowledgement is received, the JMS provider would notify the application by invoking the onCompletion method on the application-specified CompletionListener object. If for some reason the acknowledgement is not received the JMS provider would notify the application by invoking the CompletionListener's onException method. In those cases where the JMS specification permits a lower level of reliability, a normal synchronous send might not wait for an acknowledgement. In that case it is expected that an asynchronous send would be similar to a synchronous send: the JMS provider would send the message to the remote JMS server and then return without waiting for an acknowledgement. However the JMS provider would still notify the application that the send had completed by invoking the onCompletion method on the application-specified CompletionListener object.
It is up to the JMS provider to decide exactly what is performed in the calling thread and what, if anything, is performed asynchronously, so long as it satisfies the requirements given in the following sections.</description>

Setting a CompletionListener does not cause the session to be dedicated to the thread of control which calls the CompletionListener. The application thread may therefore continue to use the session after performing an asynchronous send. However the CompletionListener's callback methods must not use the session if an application thread might be using the session at the same time.</description>

			<description>Applications which perform an asynchronous send must take account of the restriction that a Message object is designed to be accessed by one logical thread of control at a time and does not support concurrent use. See section 2.8 "Multi-threading".
After the send method has returned, the application must not attempt to read the headers, properties or payload of the Message object until the CompletionListener's onCompletion or onException method has
been called. This is because the JMS provider may be modifying the Message object in another thread during this time.
A JMS provider may throw a JMSException if the application attempts to access or modify the Message object after the send method has returned and before the CompletionListener has been invoked. If the JMS provider does not throw an exception then the behaviour is undefined.</description>

			<description>A client consumes messages from a topic by creating a subscription on that topic, and creating a MessageConsumer or TopicSubscriber on that subscription.  In general, a subscription will receive a copy of every message sent to the topic. However if a message selector is specified then only those messages whose properties match the message selector will be added to the subscription.  In addition, the noLocal flag may be specified when a MessageConsumer or TopicSubscriber is created. The effect of setting this flag depends on the type of subscription and is defined in the following sections.  Each copy of the message is treated as a completely separate message. Work done on one copy has no effect on any other; acknowledging one does not acknowledge any other; one message may be delivered immediately, while another waits for its consumer to process messages ahead of it.
Subscriptions may be durable or non-durable.
A non-durable subscription exists only so long as a MessageConsumer or TopicSubscriber object exists to consume messages from it. A non-durable subscription may be either unshared or shared.
An unshared non-durable subscription does not have a name and may have only a single MessageConsumer or TopicSubscriber object associated with it. It is created automatically when the MessageConsumer or TopicSubscriber object is created. It is not persisted and is deleted automatically when it is closed. See section 6.11.1 "Unshared non-durable subscriptions" below.
A shared non-durable subscription is identified by name, which may be used to associate several MessageConsumer or TopicSubscriber objects with it. It is created automatically when the first MessageConsumer or TopicSubscriber object is created. It is not persisted and is deleted automatically when the last MessageConsumer or TopicSubscriber object is closed. See section 6.11.2 "Shared non-durable subscriptions" below.
A durable subscription is identified by a name and an optional client identifier, which may be used to associate several MessageConsumer or TopicSubscriber objects with it. A durable subscription is created automatically when the first MessageConsumer or TopicSubscriber object is created. It is persisted and continues to exist until explicitly deleted, even if there are no MessageConsumer or TopicSubscriber objects consuming messages from it. See section 4.2.3.3 "Durable subscriptions" below.</description>

			<description>An unshared non-durable subscription is the simplest way to consume messages from a topic. An unshared non-durable subscription is created, and a MessageConsumer created on that subscription, using one of the createConsumer methods on Session, JMSContext or TopicSession. Alternatively an unshared non-durable subscription is created, and a TopicSubscription created on that subscription, using one of the createSubscriber methods on TopicSession. An unshared non-durable subscription does not have a name. Each call to createConsumer or createSubscriber creates a new subscription. An unshared non-durable subscription only exists for as long as the MessageConsumer o
r TopicSubscriber exists. This means that any messages sent to the topic will only be added to the subscription whilst the
 MessageConsumer or TopicSubscriber is active. The subscription is not persisted and will be deleted (together with any un
delivered messages associated with it) when the consumer is closed.</description>

			<description>A non-durable shared subscription is used by a client which needs to be able to share the work of receiving messages from a topic subscription amongst multiple consumers. A non-durable shared subscription may therefore have more than one consumer. Each message from the subscription will be delivered to only one of the consumers on that subscription.  A shared non-durable subscription is created, and a MessageConsumer created on that subscription, using one of the createSharedConsumer methods on Session, JMSContext or TopicSession. The same methods may be used to create a MessageConsumer on an existing shared non-durable subscription.  A shared non-durable subscription is identified by a name specified by the client. A shared non-durable subscription only exists for as long as a MessageConsumer or TopicSubscriber exists on the subscription. This means that any messages sent to the topic will only be added to the subscription whilst a MessageConsumer or TopicSubscriber is active.

			<description>A durable subscription is used by a client which needs to receive all the messages published on a topic, including the ones published when there is no MessageConsumer or TopicSubscriber associated with it. The JMS provider retains a record of this durable subscription and ensures that all messages from the topic's publishers are retained until they are delivered to, and acknowledged by, a MessageConsumer or TopicSubscriber on the durable subscription or until they have expired.
A durable subscription is created, and a MessageConsumer created on that durable subscription, using the createDurableConsumer methods on a Session or TopicSession. The same methods may be used to create a MessageConsumer on an existing durable subscription. There are also createDurableSubscriber methods which have the same behavior as createDurableConsumer but which return a TopicSubscriber. These methods are deprecated since the object they return is deprecated. A durable subscription which has a MessageConsumer or TopicSubscriber associated with it is described as being active. A durable subscription which has no MessageConsumer or TopicSubscriber associated with it is described as being inactive. Only one session at a time can have a MessageConsumer or TopicSubscriber for a particular durable subscription. A durable subscription is identified by a name specified by the client and by the client identifier if set. If the client identifier was set when the durable subscription was first created then a client which subsequently wishes to create a MessageConsumer or TopicSubscriber on that durable subscription must use the same client identifier.</description>

			<description>The Java Platform, Enterprise Edition (Java EE) Specification, v7 requires support for the JMS API as part of the full Java EE platform.
The Java EE platform provides a number of additional features which are not available in the Java Platform Standard Edition (Java SE). These include the following: 1) Support for distributed transactions which are demarcated either programmatically, using methods on jakarta.transaction.UserTransaction, or automatically by the container. These are referred to in this specification as JTA transactions to distinguish them from JMS local transactions.  2) Support for JMS message-driven beans.  These features are defined in detail in other specifications including the Java EE 7 specification and the Enterprise JavaBeans 3.2 specification. However the use of the Java EE platform imposes restrictions on the way that the JMS API may be used by applications, and those restrictions are described here.  The JMS specification does not define how a Java EE container integrates with its JMS provider. Different Java EE containers may integrate with their JMS provider in different ways.  In the future, an integration point for JMS integration into J2EE platforms will be provided using the J2EE Connector Architecture.

			<description>JMS applications which run in the Java EE web or EJB container are subject to a number of restrictions in the way the JMS API may be used. These restrictions are necessary for the following reasons:
1) In a Java EE web or EJB container, a JMS provider operates as a transactional resource manager which must participate in JTA transactions as defined in the Java EE platform specification. This overrides the behaviour of JMS sessions as defined elsewhere in the JMS specification. For more details see section 12.3 "Behaviour of JMS sessions in the Java EE web or EJB container".
2) The Java EE web or EJB containers need to be able to manage the threads used to run applications.
3) The Java EE web and EJB containers perform connection management which may include the pooling of JMS connections.
The restrictions described in this section do not apply to the Java EE application client container.
Applications running in the Java EE web and EJB containers must not attempt to create more than one active (not closed) Session object per connection.</description>

			<description>The behaviour of a JMS session in respect of transactions and message acknowledgement is different for applications which run in a Java EE web or EJB container than it is for applications which run in a normal Java SE environment or in the Java EE application client container.
These differences also apply to JMS messaging context objects, since these incorporate a JMS session.
When an application creates a JMS session or messaging context in a Java EE web or EJB container, and there is an active JTA transaction in progress, then the session that is created will participate in the JTA transaction and will be committed or rolled back when the JTA transaction is committed or rolled back. Any session parameters that are specified when creating the session or messaging context are ignored. The use of local transactions or client acknowledgement is not permitted.
This applies irrespective of whether the JTA transaction is demarcated automatically by the container or programmatically using methods on jakarta.transaction.UserTransaction.
The term "session parameters" here refers to the arguments that may be passed into a call to the createSession or createContext methods to specify whether the session should use a local transaction and, if the session is non-transacted, what the acknowledgement mode should be.
When an application creates a JMS session or messaging context in a Java EE web or EJB container, and there is no active JTA transaction in progress, then the session that is created will be non-transacted and will be automatically-acknowledged. The use of local transactions or client acknowledgement is still not permitted. Parameters may be specified when creating the session or messaging context to specify whether the acknowledgement mode should be AUTO_ACKNOWLEDGE or DUPS_OK_ACKNOWLEDGE. If any other session parameter values are specified they will be ignored and an acknowledgement mode of AUTO_ACKNOWLEDGE used.
The use of local transactions or client acknowledgement is not permitted in a Java EE web or EJB container even if there is no active JTA transaction because this would require applications to be written differently depending on whether there was a JTA transaction or not.</description>

			          <description>When programmatic transaction demarcation is being used, the session should be both created and used within an active JTA transaction.
If a session or messaging context is created when there is an active JTA transaction, then after that transaction is committed or rolled back the session remains available for use in any subsequent JTA transaction until the session or messaging context is closed.
However, if a session or messaging context is created when there is an active JTA transaction but is subsequently used to send or receive messages when there is no active JTA transaction then the behaviour is undefined.
Similarly, if a session or messaging context is created when there is no active JTA transaction but subsequently used to send or receive messages when there is an active JTA transaction then the behaviour is undefined.
The Bean Provider should not make use of the JMS request/reply paradigm (sending of a JMS message, followed by the synchronous receipt of a reply to that message) within a single transaction. Because a JMS message is typically not delivered to its final destination until the transaction commits, the receipt of the reply within the same transaction will not take place.</description>

			<description>Support for injection.
Injection of JMSContext objects is supported in those Java EE application classes which support dependency injection using CDI and for which CDI support has been enabled by means of a META_INF/beans.xml descriptor.
Section EE.5.20 of the Java EE specification lists the application classes that support dependency injection using CDI.
Section 12.1 of the CDI specification specifies how CDI support may be enabled for a particular application.</description>

			<description>Injection syntax.
Applications may declare a field of type javax.jms.JMSContext and annotate it with the javax.inject.Inject annotation:
@Inject private JMSContext context; The container will inject a JMSContext. This object will have a scope as defined by section 12.4.3 "Scope of injected JMSContext objects". The annotation javax.jms.JMSConnectionFactory may be used to specify the JNDI lookup name of the ConnectionFactory used to create the JMSContext. For example:
@Inject @JMSConnectionFactory("jms/connectionFactory") private JMSContext context;
If no lookup name is specified or the JMSConnectionFactory annotation is omitted then the platform default JMS connection factory will be used.
The annotation javax.jms.JMSPasswordCredential may be used to specify a user name and password which will be used when the JMSContext is created. For example:
@Inject @JMSConnectionFactory("jms/connectionFactory") @JMSPasswordCredential(userName="admin",password="mypassword")
private JMSContext context;
Since it is undesirable to hardcode clear text passwords in an application, the password may be specified as an alias:
@Inject @JMSPasswordCredential( username="admin", password="${ALIAS=myAdminPassword}")
private JMSContext context;
The use of a password alias allows the password to be defined in a secure manner separately from the application. See the Java EE 7 platform specification for more information on password aliases.
The annotation javax.jms.JMSSessionMode may be used to specify the session mode of the JMSContext. For example:
@Inject
@JMSConnectionFactory("jms/connectionFactory")
@JMSSessionMode(JMSContext.AUTO_ACKNOWLEDGE)
private JMSContext context;
The meaning and possible values of session mode are the same as for the ConnectionFactory method createContext(int sessionMode):
In the Java EE application client container, session mode may be set to any of JMSContext.SESSION_TRANSACTED, JMSContext.CLIENT_ACKNOWLEDGE, JMSContext.AUTO_ACKNOWLEDGE or
JMSContext.DUPS_OK_ACKNOWLEDGE. If no session mode is specified or the JMSSessionMode annotation is omitted a session mode of JMSContext.AUTO_ACKNOWLEDGE will be used.
In a Java EE web or EJB container, when there is an active JTA transaction in progress, session mode is ignored and the JMSSessionMode annotation is unnecessary.
In a Java EE web or EJB container, when there is no active JTA transaction in progress, session mode may be set to either of JMSContext.AUTO_ACKNOWLEDGE or JMSContext.DUPS_OK_ACKNOWLEDGE. If no session mode is specified or the JMSSessionMode annotation is omitted a session mode of JMSContext.AUTO_ACKNOWLEDGE will be used.
For more information about the use of session mode when creating a messaging context, see section 12.3 "Behaviour of JMS sessions in the Java EE web or EJB container" and the API documentation for the ConnectionFactory method createContext(int sessionMode).</description>

			<description>Scope of injected JMSContext objects.
The scope of an injected JMSContext defines whether different injected JMSContext objects will actually refer to the same JMSContext object
It also defines when the injected JMSContext will be closed by the container. When the object falls out of scope, the container will automatically call close().
The scope of an injected JMSContext object will depend on whether it is used in a transaction.
If an injected JMSContext is used in a JTA transaction (both bean-managed and container-managed), its scope will be that of the transaction. This means that:
The JMSContext object will be automatically created the first time it is used within the transaction.
The JMSContext object will be automatically closed when the transaction is committed.
Within the same JTA transaction, different injected JMSContext objects which are injected using identical annotations will all refer to the same JMSContext object.
If an injected JMSContext is used when there is no JTA transaction then its scope will be the existing CDI scope @RequestScoped. This means that:
The JMSContext object will be automatically created the first time it is used within a request.
The JMSContext object will be automatically closed when the request ends.
Within the same request, different injected JMSContext objects which are injected using identical annotations will all refer to the same JMSContext object.
If an injected JMSContext is used both in a JTA transaction and outside a JTA transaction then separate JMSContext objects will be used, with a separate JMSContext object being used for each JTA transaction as described above.</description>

			<description>Restrictions on use of injected JMSContext objects.
Within the same scope, different injected JMSContext objects which are injected using identical annotations will all refer to the same JMSContext object.
This means that they will all use the same connection. This will reduce the resource usage of the application and improve performance.
It also means that messages would be sent using the same session. Messages sent using different JMSContext objects in the same scope will be therefore received in order in which they were sent (see section 6.2.9.2 "Order of message sends" for a few qualifications).
However, to avoid the possibility of code in one bean having an unexpected effect on a different bean, the following methods which change the public state of a JMSContext will not be permitted if the JMSContext is injected.
O setClientID
O setExceptionListener
O stop
O acknowledge
O commit
O rollback
O recover
O setAutoStart
O start
O close
These methods must throw a JMSRuntimeException if the JMSContext is injected. These restrictions do not apply when the JMSContext is managed by the application; though note that several of these methods are in any case prohibited in a Java EE web or EJB container.</description>
