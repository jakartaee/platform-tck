The web application deployment descriptor contains an element that causes a J2EE
product to associate an HTML form resource (perhaps dynamically generated) with
the web application. If the Deployer chooses this form of authentication (over HTTP
basic, or SSL certificate based authentication), this form must be used as the user
interface for login to the application.
The form based login mechanism and web application deployment descriptors
are described in the servlet specification.

			<description>Web containers are required to support access to web resources by clients that have
not authenticated themselves to the container. This is the common mode of access to
web resources on the Internet.
A web container reports that no user has been authenticated by returning null
from the HttpServletRequest method getUserPrincipal. This is different than
the corresponding result for EJB containers. The EJB specification requires that
the EJBContext method getCallerPrincipal always return a valid Principal
object. The method can never return null.
Components running in a web container must be able to call enterprise beans
even when no user has been authenticated in the web container. When a call is
made in such a case from a component in a web container to an enterprise bean, a
J2EE product must provide a principal for use in the call.
A J2EE product may provide a principal for use by unauthenticated callers
using many approaches, including, but not limited to:
 Always use a single distinguished principal.
 Use a different distinguished principal per server, or per session, or per application.
 Allow the deployer or system administrator to choose which principal to use
through the Run As capability of the web and enterprise bean containers.

			<description> The application client container must provide authentication of application users to
satisfy the authentication and authorization constraints enforced by the enterprise
bean containers and web containers.
The container will provide an appropriate user interface for interactions with
the user to gather authentication data. In addition, an application client may
provide a class that implements the
javax.security.auth.callback.CallbackHandler interface and specify the class
name in its deployment descriptor

The Deployer may override the callback
handler specified by the application and require use of the container's default
authentication user interface instead.
If use of a callback handler has been configured by the Deployer, the
application client container must instantiate an object of this class and use it for all
authentication interactions with the user. The application's callback handler must
support all the Callback objects specified in the javax.security.auth.callback
package.
Application clients execute in an environment controlled by a J2SE security
manager and are subject to the security permissions defined in J2EE.6.2, "Java 2
Platform, Standard Edition (J2SE) Requirements". Although this specification does not
define the relationship between the operating system identity associated with a
running application client and the authenticated user identity, support for single
signon requires that the J2EE product be able to relate these identities

			<description> A Product Provider must support both of the following:
1. Configured Identity.AJ2EE container must be able to authenticate for access
to the resource using a principal and authentication data specified by a Deployer
at deployment time.The authentication must not depend in any way on data
provided by the application components. Providing for the confidential storage
of the authentication information is the responsibility of the Product Provider.
2. Programmatic Authentication. The J2EE product must provide for specification
of the principal and authentication data for a resource by the application
component at runtime using appropriate APIs. The application may obtain the
principal and authentication data through a variety of mechanisms, including
receiving them as parameters, obtaining them from the component's environment,
and so forth.

			<description> the following techniques are recommended but not required by
this specification:
1. Principal Mapping. A resource can have a principal and attributes that are determined
by a mapping from the identity and security attributes of the requesting
principal. In this case, a resource principal is not based on inheritance of
the identity or security attributes from a requesting principal, but gets its identity
and security attributes based on the mapping.
2. Caller Impersonation. A resource principal acts on behalf of a requesting
principal. Acting on behalf of a caller principal requires delegation of the caller's
identity and credentials to the underlying resource manager. In some scenarios,
a requesting principal can be a delegate of an initiating principal and
the resource principal is transitively impersonating an initiating principal.
The support for principal delegation is typically specific to a security mechanism.
For example, Kerberos supports a mechanism for the delegation of
authentication. (Refer to the Kerberos v5 specification for more details.)
3. Credentials Mapping. This technique may be used when an application server
and an EIS support different authentication domains. For example:
a. The initiating principal may have been authenticated and have public key
certificate-based credentials.
b. The security environment for the resource manager may be configured
with the Kerberos authentication service.
The application server is configured to map the public key certificate-based
credentials associated with the initiating principal to the Kerberos credentials.

			<description>Code Authorization
A J2EE product may restrict the use of certain J2SE classes and methods to secure
and insure proper operation of the system. The minimum set of permissions that a
J2EE product is required to grant to a J2EE application is defined in
Section J2EE.6.2, Java 2 Platform, Standard Edition (J2SE) Requirements. All
J2EE products must be capable of deploying application components with exactly
these permissions.
A J2EE Product Provider may choose to enable selective access to resources
using the Java 2 protection model. The mechanism used is J2EE product
dependent.

			<description> Propagated Caller Identities.
It must be possible to configure a J2EE product so that a propagated caller identity is
used in all authorization decisions. With this configuration, for all calls to all
enterprise beans from a single application within a single J2EE product, the
principal name returned by the EJBContext method getCallerPrincipal must be
the same as that returned by the first enterprise bean in the call chain. If the first
enterprise bean in the call chain is called by a servlet or JSP page, the principal
name must be the same as that returned by the HttpServletRequest method
getUserPrincipal in the calling servlet or JSP page. (However, if the
HttpServletRequest method getUserPrincipal returns null, the principal used in
calls to enterprise beans is not specified by this specification, although it must still
be possible to configure enterprise beans to be callable by such components.)
Note that this does not require delegation of credentials, only identification of
the caller. A single principal must be the principal used in authorization decisions
for access to all enterprise beans in the call chain. The requirements in this section
apply only when a J2EE product has been configured to propagate caller identity

			<description> Run As Identities
J2EE products must also support the Run As capability that allows the Application
Component Provider and the Deployer to specify an identity under which an
enterprise bean or web component must run. In this case it is the Run As identity
that is propagated to subsequent components, rather than the original caller identity.

			<description>The J2EE security permissions set defines the minimum set of permissions that
application components can expect. All J2EE products must be capable of
deploying application components that require the set of permissions described
here. The Product Provider must ensure that the application components do not use
functions that conflict with the J2EE security permission set.

The exact set of security permissions for application components in use at a
particular installation is a matter of policy outside the scope of this specification.
Some J2EE products will allow the set of permissions available to a component to
be configurable, providing some components with more or fewer permissions than
those described here. A future version of this specification will allow these
security requirements to be specified in the deployment descriptor for application
components. At the present time, application components that need permissions
not in this minimal set should describe their requirements in their documentation.

Table J2EE.6-2 lists the J2EE security permissions set. This is the typical set of
permissions that components of each type should expect to have.

			<description>          If an application includes a bundled version of an optional
          package, and the same optional package exists as an installed
          optional package, the instance of the optional package bundled
          with the application should be used in preference to any

          it requires without being influenced by any installed optional
          packages. Note that if the optional package is also a required
          component of the J2EE platform version on which the application
          is being deployed, the platform version may take precedence.

			<description>          In all cases, the deployment of a J2EE application must be
          complete before the container delivers requests to any of the

          and resource adapters only after initialization of the component
          has completed.

			<description>          
The deployment tools for J2EE containers must validate the deployment
descriptors against the J2EE deployment descriptor schemas or DTDs that
correspond to the deployment descriptors being processed. The appropriate
schema or DTD is chosen by analyzing the deployment descriptor to determine
which version it claims to conform to. Validation errors must cause an error to be
reported to the Deployer. The deployment tool may allow the Deployer to correct
the error and continue deployment.

			<description>          When deploying a stand-alone J2EE module the deployment tool must
          deploy all of the components listed in the J2EE module deployment
          descriptor according to the deployment requirements of the
          respective J2EE component specification. If the module is a type
          that contains JAR format files (for example, Web and Connector
          modules), all classes in .jar files within the module referenced
          from other JAR files within the module using the Class-Path
          manifest header must be included in the deployment. If the
          module, or any JAR format files within the module, declares a
          dependency on an installed optional package, that dependency must
          be satisfied.

			<description>The J2EE authentication requirements for application clients are the same as for
other J2EE components, and the same authentication techniques may be used as for
other J2EE application components.

No authentication is necessary when accessing unprotected web resources.
When accessing protected web resources, the usual varieties of authentication
may be used, namely HTTP Basic authentication, SSL client authentication, or
HTTP Login Form authentication. Lazy authentication may be used.

Authentication is required when accessing protected enterprise beans. The
authentication mechanisms for enterprise beans include those required in the EJB
specification for enterprise bean interoperability. Lazy authentication may be
used.

			<description> If the container interacts with the user to gather authentication data, the
container must provide an appropriate user interface. In addition, an application
client may provide a class that implements the
javax.security.auth.callback.CallbackHandler interface and specify the class
name in its deployment descriptor (see Section J2EE.9.7, J2EE Application
Client XML Schemas for details). The Deployer may override the callback
handler specified by the application and use of the container's default
authentication user interface instead.
If a callback handler is configured by the Deployer, the application client
container must instantiate an object of this class and use it for all authentication
interactions with the user. The application's callback handler must fully support
Callback objects specified in the javax.security.auth.callback package.
