authentication.
All Java EE web servers must maintain a login session for each web user. It must be
possible for a login session to span more than one application, allowing a user to log
in once and access multiple applications. The required login session support is
described in the servlet specification. This requirement of a session for each web
user supports single signon.

            <description>  Form Based Login
The web application deployment descriptor contains an element that causes a Java EE
product to associate an HTML form resource (perhaps dynamically generated) with
the web application. If the Deployer chooses this form of authentication (over HTTP
basic, or SSL certificate based authentication), this form must be used as the user
interface for login to the application.
The form based login mechanism and web application deployment descriptors
are described in the servlet specification.

            <description>Web containers are required to support access to web resources by clients that have
not authenticated themselves to the container. This is the common mode of access to
web resources on the Internet.
A web container reports that no user has been authenticated by returning null
from the HttpServletRequest method getUserPrincipal. This is different than
the corresponding result for EJB containers. The EJB specification requires that
the EJBContext method getCallerPrincipal always return a valid Principal
object. The method can never return null.
Components running in a web container must be able to call enterprise beans
even when no user has been authenticated in the web container. When a call is
made in such a case from a component in a web container to an enterprise bean, a
Java EE product must provide a principal for use in the call.
A Java EE product may provide a principal for use by unauthenticated callers
using many approaches, including, but not limited to:
 Always use a single distinguished principal.
 Use a different distinguished principal per server, or per session, or per application.
 Allow the deployer or system administrator to choose which principal to use
through the Run As capability of the web and enterprise bean containers.

            <description> The application client container must provide authentication of application users to
satisfy the authentication and authorization constraints enforced by the enterprise
bean containers and web containers.
The container will provide an appropriate user interface for interactions with
the user to gather authentication data. In addition, an application client may
provide a class that implements the
javax.security.auth.callback.CallbackHandler interface and specify the class
name in its deployment descriptor

The Deployer may override the callback
handler specified by the application and require use of the container's default
authentication user interface instead.
If use of a callback handler has been configured by the Deployer, the
application client container must instantiate an object of this class and use it for all
authentication interactions with the user. The application's callback handler must
support all the Callback objects specified in the javax.security.auth.callback
package.
Application clients execute in an environment controlled by a J2SE security
manager and are subject to the security permissions defined in EE.6.2, "Java 2
Platform, Standard Edition (J2SE) Requirements". Although this specification does not
define the relationship between the operating system identity associated with a
running application client and the authenticated user identity, support for single
signon requires that the Java EE product be able to relate these identities

            <description> A Product Provider must support both of the following:
1. Configured Identity.A Java EE container must be able to authenticate for access
to the resource using a principal and authentication data specified by a Deployer
at deployment time.The authentication must not depend in any way on data
provided by the application components. Providing for the confidential storage
of the authentication information is the responsibility of the Product Provider.
2. Programmatic Authentication. The  Java EE product must provide for specification
of the principal and authentication data for a resource by the application
component at runtime using appropriate APIs. The application may obtain the
principal and authentication data through a variety of mechanisms, including
receiving them as parameters, obtaining them from the component's environment,
and so forth.

            <id>JavaEE:SPEC:28</id>
            <description> the following techniques are recommended but not required by
this specification:
1. Principal Mapping. A resource can have a principal and attributes that are determined
by a mapping from the identity and security attributes of the requesting
principal. In this case, a resource principal is not based on inheritance of
the identity or security attributes from a requesting principal, but gets its identity
and security attributes based on the mapping.
2. Caller Impersonation. A resource principal acts on behalf of a requesting
principal. Acting on behalf of a caller principal requires delegation of the caller's
identity and credentials to the underlying resource manager. In some scenarios,
a requesting principal can be a delegate of an initiating principal and
the resource principal is transitively impersonating an initiating principal.
The support for principal delegation is typically specific to a security mechanism.
For example, Kerberos supports a mechanism for the delegation of
authentication. (Refer to the Kerberos v5 specification for more details.)
3. Credentials Mapping. This technique may be used when an application server
and an EIS support different authentication domains. For example:
a. The initiating principal may have been authenticated and have public key
certificate-based credentials.
b. The security environment for the resource manager may be configured
with the Kerberos authentication service.
The application server is configured to map the public key certificate-based
credentials associated with the initiating principal to the Kerberos credentials.

            <description>Code Authorization
A  Java EE product may restrict the use of certain J2SE classes and methods to secure
and insure proper operation of the system. The minimum set of permissions that a
 Java EE product is required to grant to a  Java EE application is defined in
Section  Java EE.6.2, Java 2 Platform, Standard Edition (J2SE) Requirements. All
 Java EE products must be capable of deploying application components with exactly
these permissions.
A  Java EE Product Provider may choose to enable selective access to resources
using the Java 2 protection model. The mechanism used is  Java EE product
dependent.

            <description> Propagated Caller Identities.
It must be possible to configure a  Java EE product so that a propagated caller identity is
used in all authorization decisions. With this configuration, for all calls to all
enterprise beans from a single application within a single  Java EE product, the
principal name returned by the EJBContext method getCallerPrincipal must be
the same as that returned by the first enterprise bean in the call chain. If the first
enterprise bean in the call chain is called by a servlet or JSP page, the principal
name must be the same as that returned by the HttpServletRequest method
getUserPrincipal in the calling servlet or JSP page. (However, if the
HttpServletRequest method getUserPrincipal returns null, the principal used in
calls to enterprise beans is not specified by this specification, although it must still
be possible to configure enterprise beans to be callable by such components.)
Note that this does not require delegation of credentials, only identification of
the caller. A single principal must be the principal used in authorization decisions
for access to all enterprise beans in the call chain. The requirements in this section
apply only when a  Java EE product has been configured to propagate caller identity

 Java EE products must also support the Run As capability that allows the Application

enterprise bean or web component must run. In this case it is the Run As identity
that is propagated to subsequent components, rather than the original caller identity.

                An environment entry is scoped to the application component whose
                declaration contains the env-entry element. This means that the
                environment entry is not accessible from other application
                components at runtime, and that other application components may
                define env-entry elements with the same enventry- name without
                causing a name conflict.

            The application component’s naming environment is composed of four 
            logical namespaces, representing naming environments with different scopes. 
            The four namespaces are: java:comp, java:module, java:app and java:global.

            Names in the namespace java:comp are per-component 
            (for example, per enterprise bean). Except for components in a web module, 
            each component gets its own java:comp namespace, not shared with any other component. 
            Components in a web module do not have their own private component namespace.

            Names in the namespace java:module are shared by all components in a 
            module (for example, all enterprise beans in a single EJB module, or all 
            components in a web module).

            Names in the namespace java:app are shared by all components in 
            all modules in a single application, where “single application” means a single 
            deployment unit, such as a single ear file, a single module deployed standalone, etc. 
            For example, a war file and an EJB jar file in the same ear file would both have 
            access to resources in the java:app namespace.

                The Java EE Product Provider must implement the java:comp/env
                environment naming context, and provide it to the application
                component instances at runtime. The naming context must include
                all the environment entries declared by the Application Component
                Provider, with their values supplied in the deployment descriptor
                or set by the Deployer.

            Each injection of an object corresponds to a JNDI lookup. 
            Whether a new instance of the requested object is injected, or whether a 
            shared instance is injected, is determined by the rules described below. 

            1. A shared instance of the object may be returned in following cases: 
            a. The container knows the object is immutable or knows that the application 
            can’t change the state of the object.
            b. The object is defined to be a singleton, such that only one instance of 
            the object may exist in the JVM. 
            c. The name used for the lookup is defined to 
            return an instance of the object that might be shared.

            2. In the case of resource adapter connection objects, it is the resource 
            adapter’s ManagedConnectionFactory implementation that is responsible for 
            satisfying this requirement.

            A field of a class may be the target of injection. The field must not be final.
            By default, the name of the field is combined with the fully qualified name of the 
            class and used directly as the name in the application component’s naming context.

            Annotations may also be applied to the class itself. These annotations 
            declare an entry in the application component’s environment but do not cause the 
            resource to be injected. Instead, the application component is expected to use JNDI 
            or a component context lookup method to lookup the entry. When the annotation is 
            applied to the class, the JNDI name and the environment entry type must be 
            specified explicitly.

                An EJB reference is scoped to the application component whose
                declaration contains the ejb-ref element. This means that the EJB
                reference is not accessible from other application components at
                runtime, and that other application components may define ejb-ref
                elements with the same ejb-ref-name without causing a name
                conflict.

                Its often convenient to declare a field or method as an 
                injection target, but specify a default value in the code, 
                as illustrated in the following example.  
                   // The maximum number of tax exemptions, configured by the Deployer.
                   @Resource int maxExemptions = 4; // defaults to 4 
                To support this case, the container must only inject a value 
                for this resource if the deployer has specified a value to override 
                the default value.

                The env-entryvalue element in the deployment descriptor is optional 
                when an injection target is specified. If the element is not specified, 
                no value will be injected. In addition, if the element is not 
                specified, the named resource is not initialized in the naming context; 
                explicit lookups of the named resource will fail.

                components environment, the Application Component Provider 
                must not use a env-entry element to declare it. Instead,

                Each ejb-ref or ejb-local-ref element describes the interface 
                requirements that the referencing application component has for 
                the referenced enterprise bean. The ejb-ref element contains a 
                description element and the ejb-ref-name, ejb-ref-type, home, 
                and remote elements. The ejb-ref-name element specifies the EJB 
                reference name. Its value is the environment entry name used in 
                the application component code. The ejb-reftype element specifies 
                the expected type of the enterprise bean. Its value must be either 
                Entity or Session.

                The Deployer must ensure that all the declared EJB references 
                are bound to the homes or instances of enterprise beans that 
                exist in the operational environment. The Deployer may use, 
                for example, the JNDI LinkRef mechanism to create a symbolic 
                link to the actual JNDI name of the target enterprise bean.

                The Deployer must ensure that the target enterprise bean 
                is type-compatible with the types declared for the EJB 
                reference. This means that the target enterprise bean 
                must be of the type indicated in the ejb-ref-type element 
                or specified via the EJB annotation, and that the home and 
                remote interfaces of the target enterprise bean must be 
                Java type-compatible with the home and remote interfaces 
                declared in the EJB reference (if specified).

                factories using logical names called resource manager connection factory

                references to the resource manager connection factories that exist in 
                the target operational environment.

                A resource manager connection factory reference is scoped to the
                application component whose declaration contains the resource-ref
                element. This means that the resource manager connection factory
                reference is not accessible from other application components at
                runtime, and that other application components may define
                resource-ref elements with the same res-ref-name without causing
                a name conflict.

                connection factory reference declared by the application
                component, and the container must be able to use the
                username/password combination for user authentication when obtaining
                a connection by invoking the resource manager connection factory.

                A resource environment reference is scoped to the application
                component whose declaration contains the resource-env-ref
                element. This means that the resource environment reference is

                Although the resource environment reference is an entry in the 
                application components environment, the Application Component 
                Provider must not use a env-entry element to declare it. Instead, 
                the Application Component Provider must declare all references 
                to administered objects associated with resources using either 
                annotations on the application components code or the 
                resource-env-ref elements of the deployment descriptor.

                is annotated with the Resource annotation to request 
                injection of a message destination reference, the

                annotation must not be specified; message destination 
                references are not shareable and do not require authentication.

                To avoid the need to rename message destinations to have unique
                names within an entire Java EE application, the Application
                Assembler may use the following syntax in the
                message-destination-link element of the referencing application
                component. The Application Assembler specifies the path name of
                the ejb-jar file containing the referenced message destination
                and appends the message-destination-name of the target
                destination separated from the path name by #. The path name is
                relative to the referencing application component jar file. In
                this manner, multiple destinations with the same
                message-destination-name may be uniquely identified.

                The Bean Provider must use persistence unit references to obtain references 
                to entity manager factories as follows:
                - Assign an entry in the application components environment to 
                  the persistence unit reference.
                - (ejb recommends but not requires) that all persistence unit references
                  be organized in the java:comp/env/persistence subcontexts of the beans env.
                - Lookup the entity manager factory for the persistence unit in the 
                  application component s environment using the EJBContext lookup 
                  method or using the JNDI API.
                - Invoke the appropriate method on the entity manager factory to 
                  obtain an entity manager instance.

                (Regarding the Declartion of Persistence Unit References in Deployment Descriptors)
                Although a persistence unit reference is an entry in the application 
                components environment, the Bean Provider must not use an env-entry 
                element to declare it. Instead, if metadata annotations are not used, 
                the Bean Provider must declare all the persistence unit references in 
                the deployment descriptor using the persistence-unit-ref elements.

                The Deployer must perform the following tasks for each persistence unit
                reference declared in the metadata annotations or deployment descriptor:
                - Bind the persistence unit reference to an entity manager factory 
                  configured for the persistence unit as specified in the persistence.xml 
                  file for the persistence unit that exists in the operational environment. 
                  The Deployer may use, for example, the JNDI LinkRef mechanism to create 
                  a symbolic link to the actual JNDI name of the entity manager factory.  
                - Provide any additional configuration information that the entity 
                  manager factory needs for managing the persistence unit, as described 
                  in the Java Persistence specification.

                  - (ejb recommends) all persistence context refs be organized in the 
                    java:comp/env/persistence subcontexts of the bean s environment.
                  - Lookup the container-managed entity manager for the persistence 
                    unit in the application component s environment using the 
                    EJBContext lookup method or using the JNDI API.

                The containers provide all application components with at least the
                Java Platform, Standard Edition, v8 (Java SE) APIs.
                Containers may provide newer versions of the Java SE platform, provided they
                meet all the Java EE platform requirements.

                All classes and interfaces required by the specifications for APIs must be
                provided by the Java EE containers. In some cases, a Java EE product is not required to
                provide objects that implement interfaces intended to be implemented by an
                application server, nevertheless, the definitions of such interfaces must be
                included in the Java EE platform.

            <description> The JavaEE security permissions set
                is a required part of the JavaEE API contract. To ensure the integrity of JavaEE
                containers, all JavaEE containers must install a security manager and must prevent
                applications from replacing or overriding the security manager.

                The JavaEE security permissions set defines the minimum set of permissions that
                application components can expect. All JavaEE products must be capable of
                deploying application components that require the set of permissions described
                here. The Product Provider must ensure that the application components do not use
                functions that conflict with the JavaEE security permission set.

                The exact set of security permissions for application components in use at a
                particular installation is a matter of policy outside the scope of this specification.
                Some JavaEE products will allow the set of permissions available to a component to
                be configurable, providing some components with more or fewer permissions than
                those described here. A future version of this specification will allow these
                security requirements to be specified in the deployment descriptor for application
                components. At the present time, application components that need permissions
                not in this minimal set should describe their requirements in their documentation.

                Table JavaEE.6-2 lists the JavaEE security permissions set. This is the typical set of
                permissions that components of each type should expect to have.

                The connection pooling and distributed transaction features are intended

                Java EE applications need to use an instance of org.omg.CORBA.ORB 
                to perform many Java IDL and RMI-IIOP operations. The default ORB 
                returned by a call to ORB.init(new String[0], null) must be usable 
                for such purposes; an application need not be aware of the implementation 
                classes used for the ORB and RMI-IIOP support.n

                it is often advantageous to share an ORB instance among components 
                in an application. To support such usage, all web, enterprise bean,

                instance in the JNDI namespace under the name java:comp/ORB.

                The RMI-IIOP specification describes how portable Stub and Tie 
                classes can be created. To be portable to all implementations 
                that use a CORBA Portable Object Adapter (POA), the Tie classes 
                must extend the org.omg.PortableServer.Servant class. This is 
                typically done by using the -poa option to the rmic command. A 
                Java EE product must provide support for these portable Stub and 
                Tie classes, typically using the required CORBA POA.

                Application components in the web and EJB containers must not attempt to

                An attempt to use the Connection object's createSession method when an 
                active Session object exists for that connection should be prohibited by 
                the container. The container may throw a JMSException if the application

                A JAR format file (such as a .jar file, .war file, or .rar file)
                can reference a .jar file by naming the referenced .jar file in a
                Class-Path header in the referencing JAR file's Manifest
                file. The Java EE deployment tools must process all such referenced
                files when processing a Java EE module. The deployment tool must
                install the .jar files in a way that preserves the relative
                references between the files. All referenced .jar files must

            <description>          If an application includes a bundled version of an optional
          package, and the same optional package exists as an installed
          optional package, the instance of the optional package bundled
          with the application should be used in preference to any
          installed version of the optional package. This allows an
          application to bundle exactly the version of an optional package
          it requires without being influenced by any installed optional
          packages. Note that if the optional package is also a required
          component of the Java EE platform version on which the application
          is being deployed, the platform version may take precedence.

                In addition to allowing access to referenced classes, as
                described above, any resources contained in the referenced JAR
                files must also be accessible using the Class and ClassLoader
                getResource methods, as allowed by the security permissions of
                the application. An application will typically have the security
                permissions required to access resources in any of the JAR files
                packaged with the application.

                JAR format files of all types may contain an Extension-List
                attribute in their Manifest file, indicating a dependency on an
                installed optional package. The Java EE platform specification
                requires support for such attributes for all component types and
                corresponding JAR format files. The deployment tool is required
                to check such dependency information and reject the deployment of
                any component for which the dependency can not be met.

                After the application is created, Java EE modules may be added 
                or removed before deployment. When adding or removing a module 
                the following steps must be performed:
                   - Decide on a location in the application pkg for the new module.
                   - Copy the new JavaEE modules to the desired location in the app package.
                   - Edit the deployment descriptors to link dependencies which are
                     internally satisfied by the Java EE modules included in the app.
                   - Edit the Java EE application deployment descriptor to meet the
                     content requirements of the Java EE platform and the validity 
                     requirements of the Java EE:application XML DTD or schema.

                In all cases, the deployment of a Java EE application must be
                complete before the container delivers requests to any of the
                application's components. When an application is started, the
                container must deliver requests to enterprise bean components
                immediately. Containers must deliver requests to web components
                and resource adapters only after initialization of the component
                has completed.

                The deployment tools for Java EE containers must validate the deployment
                descriptors against the Java EE deployment descriptor schemas or DTDs that
                correspond to the deployment descriptors being processed. The appropriate
                schema or DTD is chosen by analyzing the deployment descriptor to determine
                which version it claims to conform to. Validation errors must cause an error to be
                reported to the Deployer. The deployment tool may allow the Deployer to correct
                the error and continue deployment.

                modules), all classes in .jar files within the module referenced

                manifest header must be included in the deployment. If the

                The Java EE authentication requirements for application clients are 
                the same as for other Java EE components, and the same authentication 
                techniques may be used as for other Java EE application components.

                No authentication is necessary when accessing unprotected web resources.
                When accessing protected web resources, the usual varieties of authentication
                may be used, namely HTTP Basic authentication, SSL client authentication, or
                HTTP Login Form authentication. Lazy authentication may be used.

                Authentication is required when accessing protected enterprise beans. The
                authentication mechanisms for enterprise beans include those required in the EJB
                specification for enterprise bean interoperability. Lazy authentication may be
                used.

                If the container interacts with the user to gather authentication data, the
                container must provide an appropriate user interface. In addition, an application
                client may provide a class that implements the
                javax.security.auth.callback.CallbackHandler interface and specify the class
                name in its deployment descriptor (see Section EE .10.7, Java EE  Application
                Client XML Schemas for details). The Deployer may override the callback
                handler specified by the application and use of the container's default
                authentication user interface instead.
                If a callback handler is configured by the Deployer, the application client
                container must instantiate an object of this class and use it for all authentication
                interactions with the user. The application's callback handler must fully support
                Callback objects specified in the javax.security.auth.callback package.

                    - do not process annotations if a (full) app deployment 
                      descriptor file is a version of:  greater or = 1.2 and less than 5.0
                    - do process if there is a partial (ie non-full)
                      (5.0) application deployment descriptor file.
                    - do process if there is no application app deployment
                      descriptor file.

                The metadata-complete attribute defines whether the application client deployment 
                descriptor is complete, or whether the class files available to the application client 
                module should be examined for annotations that specify deployment information.
                If the value of the metadata-complete attribute is specified as "true", the deployment 
                tool must ignore any annotations that specify such deployment information in the class 
                files packaged in the application client jar file. Such annotations must also be ignored 
                in the class files that are available to the application client module.

                      There is not a spec defined way for how to prevent app components
                      from performing operations when they dont have required perms.
                      For instance, failure could occur at runtime or at deploy time.
                      And deploy failures are not spec defined on how to fail.
                      Technically this is testable but its not reasonable to test failure
                      scenarios in current CTS framework.

                isnt capable.  Maybe its capable but default config chooses to grant those perms.

                   In particular, the temporary file directory made available through the

                part of the file system.
                   The Java EE Product must be capable of using the security manager to enforce 
                that an application only has access to the part of the filesystem namespace

                Cant test this because while we may not explicitly grant any RuntimePermissions to 
                an app module, there is no guarantee the app server is not granting RuntimePerms

                Since the specific set of permissions granted to a successfully deployed 
                application is a function of the security policy for the installation and 
                the permissions declared within the permissions.xml file, the application 
                component provider is ensured that the effective permission set consists of 
                at least those permissions that are declared within the application.

                This means that if we include a permission that is defined in permission.xml
                then our module should have that permission - even if its not explicitly 
                granted at the appserver level.

                By creating a user defined permission and assigning grants to it in
                permissions.xml, we can assume it was properly processed if our 
                permission and its grants are working.

                The permissions for a library are the same as the permissions for the 
                code that calls the library. Thus, if a library is called from a war 
                file, it gets the permissions of the war file; if the same library is 
                called from an ejb-jar file, it gets the permissions of the ejb-jar file.

                Containers must support injection points annotated with the jakarta.inject.Inject annotation only to the extent dictated by CDI.
				Per the CDI specification, dependency injection is supported on managed beans. There are currently three ways for a class to
				become a managed bean:
				1.Being an EJB session bean component.
				2.Being annotated with the ManagedBean annotation.
				3.Satisfying the conditions described in the CDI specification.
				Classes that satisfy at least one of these conditions will be eligible for full dependency injection support
				as described in the CDI specification.
