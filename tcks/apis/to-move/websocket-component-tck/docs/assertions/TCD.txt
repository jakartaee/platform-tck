TCK Coverage Document for JSR-356 JavaTM API for WebSocket Specification


TCK Components:
---------------
- User's Guide
- Compatibility Rules
- Configuration Instructions
- Test Suite
- API Tests 
- Signature Tests
- End-to-End Tests
- Framework Code
- JavaTest TM Harness


Terminology of Metrics
----------------------
- Assertion: A specific statement of functionality or behavior derived from a
  specification. A testable assertion is one that can be validated in an
  implementation by testing.
- Test: A binary application (or script) comprised of one or more Test Cases.
- Test Case: A single set of test inputs, execution conditions, and expected
  results developed to verify an implementation's conformance with a specific
  assertion.
- Specification Assertion Coverage: Ratio of all assertions tested by at least
  one test case to the total number of testable assertions defined by the
  specification.
- API Coverage: Ratio of methods directly exercised by test cases to the total
  number of methods defined by the specification.


Coverage
--------
********************************************************************************
  spec total       : 84
  spec tested total: 30
  api total        : 210
  api tested total : 113
  
- Total testable assertions derived from Java API for WebSocket Specification and Javadoc: 

         84 specification assertions
     +  210 API assertions          
     -------------------------------
        294 testable assertions     

- Total testable assertions tested

         30 specification assertions tested
     +  113 API assertions tested 
     --------------------------------------
        143 testable assertions tested    

  - 35.71% of testable specification assertions tested
  - 53.81% of testable API assertions tested          
  - 48.64% of all (specification and API) assertions tested

 
- Assertions were identified through the use of CTS Tools for API assertions,
  and assertion markup inside Java API for WebSocket Specification

- Number of tests in the TCK: 263
    - Note, this total may change before the WebSocket TCK ships.

- API Signature Coverage: 100% of all public and protected members are
  validated by the signature test included with the TCK.


Quality Assurance
-----------------
- The TCK was run using representative configurations of the JavaEE Reference
  Implementation on the following platforms, note all platforms use Java SE 7:
   * Ubuntu 12.10
   * Fedora 18
   * openSUSE 12.2
   * Solaris 11.1 Sparc
   * Solaris 11.1 X86
   * Solaris 10 Sparc
   * MacOS 10.8
   * Oracle Linux Server release 6.4
   * Windows XP Professional
   * Windows 2008

- Code quality was demonstrated through the use of code reviews and inspections
- User's Guide was constructed from the standard CTS User's Guide template
- Documentation instructions were verified and tested


Justification of Adequacy
-------------------------
The WebSocket TCK Version 2.1 provides a comprehensive set of tests to ensure
all implementations of the WebSocket 2.1 specification are compatible.  As with all
TCKs it is impossible to provide tests for 100% assertion coverage.  Note, while
the CTS may not have tests for all assertions in the WebSocket 2.1 specification, all
implementations must be compatible with the specification.

Untested assertions are due to the effects of late specification changes, and
the availability and cost of test development resources.
