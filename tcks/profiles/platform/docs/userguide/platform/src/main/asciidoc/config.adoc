= Setup and Configuration

This chapter describes how to set up the Jakarta EE {tck_version} Platform TCK test suite and
configure it to work with your test environment. It is recommended that you first set up the testing environment using the Jakarta EE {tck_version} CI and then with your Jakarta EE {tck_version} server.

This chapter includes the following topics:

* <<allowed-modifications>>
* <<configuring-the-test-environment>>
* <<configuring-a-jakarta-ee-11-server>>
* <<modifying-environment-settings-for-specific-technology-tests>>

[[allowed-modifications]]
== Allowed Modifications

You can modify the following test suite components only:

* Your implementation of the porting package
* `ts.jte` environment file
* The vendor-specific SQL files in `<TS_HOME>/bin/sql`
* Any files in `<TS_HOME>/bin` and `<TS_HOME>/bin/xml`

[[configuring-the-test-environment]]
== Configuring the Test Environment

The instructions in this section and in <<configuring-your-application-server-as-the-vi>> step you through the configuration process for the Linux and Microsoft Windows.

The primary location of any configuration settings you are likely to make is the `<TS_HOME>/bin/ts.jte` environment file. You may also want to modify the
 `initdb.xml` Ant configuration files and the vendor-specific SQL files. These two files contain configure the Jakarta EE {tck_version} CI and its associated database in order to pass the TCK. An Implementer may choose to implement these targets to work with their server environment to perform the steps described in <<configuring-your-application-server-as-the-vi>>.

[NOTE]
====
The `<TS_HOME>/bin/ts.jte` environment file contains many properties that are no longer in use in the TCK. While we have transitioned from the JavaTest framework used in Jakarta EE 10 and earlier in Jakarta EE 11, there are still remnants in the EE 11 TCK, and these do use some properties in the `ts.jte` file.

The full list of `ts.jte` file properties that need a value is given in <<full-list-tsjte-properties>>.
====

[[config-before-you-begin]]
=== Before You Begin

In these instructions, variables in angle brackets need to be expanded
for each platform. For example, `<TS_HOME>` becomes `$TS_HOME` on
Solaris/Linux and `%TS_HOME%` on Windows. In addition, the forward
slashes (`/`) used in all of the examples need to be replaced with
backslashes (`\`) for Windows.

1.  Identify the software pieces and assemble them into the Jakarta EE {tck_version}
platform to be tested for certification.
2.  Implement the porting package APIs. +
Some functionality in the Jakarta EE {tck_version} platform is not completely specified
by an API. To handle this situation, the Jakarta EE {tck_version} Platform TCK test suite
defines a set of interfaces which serve to abstract any implementation-specific code. You must create your own implementations of the porting package interfaces to work with your
particular Jakarta EE {tck_version} server environment. See
<<implementing-the-porting-package>> for
additional information about the porting APIs. API documentation for the
porting package interfaces is available in the `<TS_HOME>/docs/api`
directory.
3.  Set up the Jakarta Platform, Enterprise Edition Compatible
Implementation (CI) server. See <<configuring-the-java-ee-ci-as-the-vi>> for a list of the modifications that must be made to run CTS against the Jakarta EE {tck_version} CI.
4.  Set up the vendor's Jakarta EE {tck_version} server implementation (VI). 
See <<configuring-your-application-server-as-the-vi>> for a list of the modifications that must be made to run CTS against the vendor's Jakarta EE {tck_version} server.
5.  Validate your configuration. Run the sample tests provided. If the tests pass, your basic
configuration is valid. See <<[validating-your-test-configuration>> for information about using Maven/Arquillian to run the sample tests.
6.  Run the TCK tests. See <<executing-tests>> for information
about using Maven to start running tests.
7. Generate

## Generate a Client Certificate

Some tests require a client certificate to be installed on the Jakarta EE {tck_version} server. The following steps describe how to generate a client certificate:
[source,bash]
----
keytool -genkeypair -alias cts -keyalg RSA -keysize 2048 -validity 365 -keystore clientcert.p12 -dname "CN=CTS, OU=Eclipse Foundation, O=Jakarta EE" -keypass changeit -storepass changeit

Generating 2,048 bit RSA key pair and self-signed certificate (SHA256withRSA) with a validity of 365 days
for: CN=CTS, OU=Eclipse Foundation, O=Jakarta EE

keytool -exportcert  -keystore clientcert.p12 -alias cts -keypass changeit -storepass changeit -file cts_cert.cer
----

The values used here match defaults used in the `ts.jte` file and example {glassfish_version} runners. Examples and default configurations expect that the keystore and certificate are located in your `<TS_HOME>/bin/certificates` directory.

[source,bash]
----
  -Djava.protocol.handler.pkgs=javax.net.ssl
  -Djavax.net.ssl.keyStore=${ts.home}/certificates/clientcert.p12
  -Djavax.net.ssl.keyStorePassword=changeit
  -Djavax.net.ssl.trustStore=<path_to_server_trustStore>
----

[[configuring-a-jakarta-ee-11-server]]
== Configuring a Jakarta EE {tck_version} Server

This section describes how to configure the Jakarta EE {tck_version} server under test.
You can run the TCK tests against the Jakarta EE {tck_version} CI or your own Jakarta
Platform, Enterprise Edition server. When performing interoperability
(interop) tests or web service-based tests, you will be running two Jakarta
EE {tck_version} CI servers, one of which must be a Jakarta EE {tck_version} CI using, or configured to use a database. For example, Eclipse {glassfish_version} is bundled and configured to use the Apache Derby database.

For the purposes of this section, it is useful to clarify three terms as
they are used here:

* Compatible Implementation (CI): Jakarta EE {tck_version} CI, for example, {glassfish_version}
* Vendor Implemention (VI): Jakarta EE {tck_version} implementation from a vendor wanting to certify; typically, the goal of running the TCK is to certify a Jakarta
EE {tck_version} VI; in some cases, for purposes of familiarizing yourself with TCK,
you may choose to run the Jakarta EE {tck_version} CI as the VI
* Bundled Derby: Apache Derby database bundled with the Jakarta EE {tck_version} CI, Eclipse {glassfish_version}

[[java-platform-enterprise-edition-server-configuration-scenarios]]
== Jakarta Platform, Enterprise Edition Server Configuration Scenarios

There are three general scenarios for configuring Jakarta EE {tck_version} servers for
Jakarta EE {tck_version} Platform TCK testing (Note: in the following images, Java EE refers to Jakarta EE.
RI should be replaced with CI for Compatible Implementation):

* Configure the Jakarta EE {tck_version} CI as the server under test +
image:img/serverpath-ri.png["CI as Server Under Test"]

Use the Jakarta EE {tck_version} CI as the Jakarta EE {tck_version} VI; you may want to do this as a
sanity check to make sure you are comfortable using the Jakarta EE {tck_version}
TCK against a known standard CI with certified sample applications
before proceeding with tests against your Jakarta EE {tck_version} VI. See
<<configuring-the-java-ee-ci-as-the-vi>> for instructions.

* Configure your Jakarta EE {tck_version} VI as Server Under Test +
image:img/serverpath-vi.png["VI as Server Under Test"]

This is the primary goal of using the Jakarta EE {tck_version} Platform TCK; you will eventually
need to configure the Jakarta EE {tck_version} implementation you want to certify. See
<<configuring-your-application-server-as-the-vi>> for instructions.

* Configure two Jakarta EE {tck_version} servers for the purpose of interop testing +
image:img/serverpath-interop.png["Two Servers for Interop Testing"]


In terms of the Jakarta EE {tck_version} Platform TCK, all TCK configuration settings are made
in the `<TS_HOME>/bin/ts.jte` file. When configuring a Jakarta EE {tck_version} server,
the important thing is to make sure that the settings you use for your
server match those in the `ts.jte` file.

These configuration scenarios are described in the following sections.

[[configuring-the-java-ee-ci-as-the-vi]]
== Configuring the Jakarta EE {tck_version} CI as the VI

To configure the Jakarta EE {tck_version} CI as the server under test (that is, to use
the Jakarta EE {tck_version} CI as the VI) follow the steps listed below. In this
scenario, the goal is simply to test the Jakarta EE {tck_version} CI against the CTS
for the purposes of familiarizing yourself with TCK test procedures. You
may also want to refer to the Quick Start guides included with the Jakarta
EE {tck_version} TCK for similar instructions.

. Set server properties in your `<TS_HOME>/bin/ts.jte` file to suit
your test environment.
Be sure to set the following properties:
..  Set the `webServerHost` property to the name of the host on which
your Web server is running that is configured with the CI.
The default setting is `localhost`.
..  Set the `webServerPort` property to the port number of the host on
which the Web server is running and configured with the CI.
The default setting is `8001`.
..  Set the database-related properties in the `<TS_HOME>/bin/ts.jte`
file. <<c.3-database-properties-in-ts.jte>> lists the names and descriptions for the database properties you need to set.
.  Install the Jakarta EE {tck_version} CI and configure basic settings, as described
in <<installation>>
.  Start the Jakarta EE {tck_version} CI application server.
Refer to the application server documentation for complete instructions.
.  Change to the `<TS_HOME>/bin` directory.
.  Start your backend database.
.  Initialize your backend database.
    Refer to <<c-configuring-your-backend-database>>
. Continue on to <<executing-tests>> for instructions on running tests.

[NOTE]
=======================================================================
If you are using MySQL or MS SQL Server as your backend database, see
<<backend-database-setup>> for additional
database setup instructions.
=======================================================================

[[configuring-your-application-server-as-the-vi]]
== Configuring Your Application Server as the VI


To use a Jakarta EE {tck_version} server other than the Jakarta EE {tck_version} CI, follow the steps
below.

.  Set server properties in your `<TS_HOME>/bin/ts.jte` file to suit your test environment. Be sure to set the following properties:

..  Set the `webServerHost` property to the name of the host on which your Web server is running that is configured with the CI. +
The default setting is `localhost`.

..  Set the `webServerPort` property to the port number of the host on which the Web server is running and configured with the CI. +
The default setting is `8001`.

..  Set the `porting.ts.url.class` property to your porting
implementation class that is used for obtaining URLs. See <<porting-package-apis>> for more information.

..  Set the database-related properties in the `<TS_HOME>/bin/ts.jte`
file. <<c.3-database-properties-in-ts.jte>> lists the names and descriptions for the database properties you need to set.

.  Install the Jakarta Platform, Enterprise Edition VI and configure basic
settings.

Whichever configuration method you choose, make sure that all configuration steps in this procedure are completed as shown.
.  Install and configure a database for the server under test.
.  Start your database.
.  Initialize your database for TCK tests.

Refer to <<c-configuring-your-backend-database>> for detailed database configuration and initialization instructions and a list of database-specific initialization targets.

.  Start your Jakarta EE {tck_version} server.
.  Set up required users and passwords.
..  Set up database users and passwords that are used for JDBC
connections. +
The Jakarta EE {tck_version} Platform TCK requires several user names, passwords, and user-to-role mappings. These need to match those set in your `ts.jte` file. By default, `user1`, `user2`, `user3, password1`, `password2`, and `password3` are set to `cts1`.

..  Set up users and passwords for your Jakarta Platform, Enterprise Edition server. +
For the purpose of running the TCK test suite, these should be set as follows:

.User Password Groups
[width="100%",cols="33%,33%,34%",options="header",]
|====================
|User |Password |Groups
|`j2ee_vi` |`j2ee_vi` |`staff`
|`javajoe` |`javajoe` |`guest`
|`j2ee` |`j2ee` |`staff`, `mgr`, `asadmin`
|`j2ee_ri` |`j2ee_ri` |`staff`
|====================

. Make sure that the appropriate JDBC 4.1-compliant database driver class, any associated database driver native libraries, and the correct database driver URL are available.

. Configure your Jakarta Platform, Enterprise Edition server to use the appropriate JDBC logical name (`jdbc/DB1`) when accessing your database server.

. Configure your Jakarta EE {tck_version} server to use the appropriate logical name (`jdbc/DBTimer`) when accessing your Jakarta Enterprise Beans timer.

. Provide access to a JNDI lookup service.

. Provide access to a Web server.

. Provide access to a Jakarta Mail server that supports the SMTP protocol. (Full Platform only)

. Install server certificates +
+
[NOTE]
======================================================================
This step needs to install server side certificates for interoperability
testing; that is, it installs the CI's server certificate to VI and VI's
server certificate into the CI. This step is necessary for mutual
authentication tests in which both the server and client authenticate to
each other.
======================================================================
+

. Install the client-side certificate in the `trustStore` on the Jakarta EE {tck_version}
server.  +
Certificates are located `<TS_HOME>/bin/certificates`. Use the
certificate that suits your environment.

..  `cts_cert.cer`: For importing the TCK client certificate into a
`truststore`

..  `clientcert.p12`: Contains TCK client certificate in `pkcs12` format

. Make the appropriate transaction interoperability setting on the Jakarta EE {tck_version} server and the server that is running the Jakarta EE {tck_version} CI.

. If necessary, refer to the sections later in this chapter for
additional configuration information you may require for your particular test goals. +

. Restart your Jakarta EE {tck_version} server.

. Install the Jakarta EE {tck_version} CI.

. Set the following properties in your `<TS_HOME>/bin/ts.jte` file. +
The current values should be saved since they will be needed later in this step.

* Set the `javaee.home.ri` property to the location where the Jakarta EE {tck_version}
CI is installed.

. Continue on to <<executing-tests>.

[[modifying-environment-settings-for-specific-technology-tests]]
== Modifying Environment Settings for Specific Technology Tests

Before you can run any of the technology-specific Jakarta EE {tck_version} Platform TCK tests,
you must supply certain information that JavaTest needs to run the tests
in your particular environment. This information exists in the
`<TS_HOME>/bin/ts.jte` environment file. This file contains sets of
name/value pairs that are used by the tests. You need to assign a valid
value for your environment for all of the properties listed in the
sections that follow.


[NOTE]
======================================================================

This section only discusses a small subset of the properties you can modify. Refer to the <<full-list-tsjte-properties>> for what other properties in the `ts.jte` file may be relevant for your particular test environment.

======================================================================


This section includes the following topics:

* <<test-harness-setup>>
* <<windows-specific-properties>>
* <<jakarta-websocket-test-setup>>
* <<jdbc-test-setup>>
* <<jakarta-mail-test-setup>>
* <<jakarta-connector-test-setup>>

[[test-harness-setup]]
=== Test Harness Setup

Verify that the following properties, which are used by the test harness, have been set in the `<TS_HOME>/bin/ts.jte` file:

[source,properties]
----
harness.temp.directory=<TS_HOME>/tmp<1>
harness.log.port=2000<2>
harness.log.traceflag=[true | false]<3>
porting.ts.login.class.1=<vendor-login-class><4>
porting.ts.url.class.1=<vendor-url-class>
porting.ts.jms.class.1=<vendor-jms-class>
porting.ts.tsHttpsURLConnection.class.1=<vendor-HttpsURLConnection-class>
----
<1> The `harness.temp.directory` property specifies a temporary directory that the harness creates and to which the TCK harness and tests write temporary files. The default setting should not need to be changed.
<2> The `harness.log.port` property specifies the port that server components of the tests use to send logging output back to the test harness. If the default port is not available on the machine running the test harness, you must edit this property and set it to an available port. The default setting is `2000`.
<3> The `harness.log.traceflag` property is used to turn on or turn off verbose debugging output for the tests. The value of the property is set to `false` by default. Set the property to `true` to turn debugging on.
<4> See <<tsjte-porting-classes>> for more information about these classes.

[[full-list-tsjte-properties]]
==== Complete List of `ts.jte' Properties

Many of these properties can simply be left to their default values. Those that need specific values are described in the relevant sections of the configuration chapter.

[[windows-specific-properties]]
=== Windows-Specific Properties

When configuring the Jakarta EE {tck_version} Platform TCK for the Windows environment, set the following properties in `<TS_HOME>/bin/ts.jte`:

* `pathsep` to semicolon (pathsep=`;`)

* `s1as.applicationRoot` to the drive on which you have installed CTS
(for example, `s1as.applicationRoot=C:`) +
When installing in the Windows environment, the Jakarta Platform,
Enterprise Edition CI, JDK, and TCK should all be installed on the same
drive. If you must install these components on different drives, also
change the `ri.applicationRoot` property in addition to the `pathsep`
and `s1as.applicationRoot` properties; for example: +
[source,properties]
----
ri.applicationRoot=C:
----


[NOTE]
======================================================================

When configuring the CI and TCK for the Windows environment, never
specify drive letters in any path properties in `ts.jte`.

======================================================================

[[jakarta-websocket-test-setup]]
=== Jakarta WebSocket Test Setup

Make sure that the following WebSocket property has been set in the
`ts.jte` file:

[source,properties]
----
ws_wait=[number_of_seconds]
----

The `ws_wait` property configures the wait time, in seconds, for the
socket to send or receive a message. A multiple of 5 of this time is
also used to test socket timeouts.

The Jakarta WebSocket tests also use the following properties: `webServerHost`
and `webServerPort`. See <<configuring-the-java-ee-ci-as-the-vi>> for more information about setting these
properties.


[NOTE]
======================================================================

The SSL related tests under
`/ts/javaeetck/src/com/sun/ts/tests/websocket/platform/jakarta/websocket/server/handshakerequest/authenticatedssl/`
use self signed certificate bundled with the TCK bundle. These
certificates are generated with localhost as the hostname and would work
only when orb.host value is set to localhost in ts.jte. If the server's
hostname is used instead of the localhost, the tests in this suite might
fail with the below exception - jakarta.websocket.DeploymentException: SSL
handshake has failed.

======================================================================


[[jdbc-test-setup]]
=== JDBC Test Setup (Full Platform Only)

The JDBC tests require you to set the timezone by modifying the `tz`
property in the `ts.jte` file. On Solaris systems, you can check the
timezone setting by looking in the file `/etc/default/init`. Valid
values for the `tz` property are in the directory
`/usr/share/lib/zoneinfo`. The default setting is `US/Eastern`. This
setting is in `/usr/share/lib/zoneinfo/US`.


[NOTE]
======================================================================
The `tz` property is only used for Linux configurations; it does not
apply to Windows.
======================================================================


[[jakarta-mail-test-setup]]
=== Jakarta Mail Test Setup (Full Platform Only)

Complete the following tasks before you run the Jakarta Mail tests:

.  Set the following properties in the `ts.jte` file: 
+
[source,properties]
----
mailuser1=[user@domain]
mailFrom=[user@domain]
mailHost=mailserver
javamail.password=password
----
+
* Set the `mailuser1` property to a valid mail address. Mail messages
generated by the Jakarta Mail tests are sent to the specified address. This
user must be created in the IMAP server.

* Set the `mailFrom` property to a mail address from which mail messages
that the Jakarta Mail tests generate will be sent.

* Set the `mailHost` property to the address of a valid mail server
where the mail will be sent.

* Set the `javamail.password` property to the password for `mailuser1`.

.  Populate your IMAP server with sample messages. +
The `com.sun.ts.tests.javamail.ee.util.fpopulate` class included in the javamail test artifact can be run with a configuration like the following to accomplish this:

[[jakarta-restful-web-services-test-setup]]
=== Jakarta RESTful Web Services Test Setup

Edit your `<TS_HOME>/bin/ts.jte` file and set the following environment variables:

.  Set the `servlet_adaptor` property to point to the Servlet adapter
class for the Jakarta RESTful Web Services implementation. +
The default setting for this property is
`org/glassfish/jersey/servlet/ServletContainer.class`, the servlet
adaptor supplied in Jersey.
.  Set the `webServerHost` property to the name of the host on which
your Web server is running that is configured with the CI.
.  Set the `webServerPort` property to the port number of the host on
which the Web server is running and configured with the CI.

[[jakarta-connector-test-setup]]
=== Jakarta Connector Test Setup (Full Platform Only)

The Jakarta Connector tests verify that a Jakarta EE {tck_version} server correctly implements the Jakarta Connector V1.7 specification. The Connector compatibility tests ensure that your Jakarta EE {tck_version} server still supports the Connector V1.0 functionality.

Your runner for the Jakarta Connector TCK tests needs to deploy the RAR files listed in <<extension-libraries>> and create the required connection resources and connection pools used for the Connector tests. The `glassfish-runner/connector-platform-tck` example runner also performs several other tasks, such as creating required users and security mappings, setting appropriate JVM options, etc. that also are needed to run the Connector tests.

[[extension-libraries]]
==== Extension Libraries

The following Connector files need to be deployed as part of VI server setup for the Jakarta Connector TCK platform tests:

* `whitebox-mixedmode.rar`
* `whitebox-tx-param.rar`
* `whitebox-multianno.rar`
* `whitebox-tx.rar`
* `whitebox-anno_no_md.rar`
* `whitebox-notx-param.rar`
* `whitebox-xa-param.rar`
* `whitebox-mdcomplete.rar`
* `whitebox-notx.rar`
* `whitebox-xa.rar`

These RAR artifacts are available in the platform TCK distribution artifacts directory. Each RAR file has a dependency on the whitebox extension library. The `jakarta.tck:whitebox` whitebox.jar file is a Shared Library that must be deployed as a separate entity that all the Jakarta Connector RAR files access. This extension library is needed to address classloading issues.

The RAR files that are used with Jakarta EE {tck_version} Platform TCK test suite differ from those that were used in other test suites. Jakarta EE {tck_version} Platform TCK no longer bundles the same common classes into every RAR file. Duplicate common classes have been removed and now exist in the `whitebox.jar` file, an Installed Library that is deployed and is made available before any other RAR files are deployed.

This was done to address the following compatibility issues:

* Portable use of Installed Libraries for specifying a resource adapter's shared libraries +
See section EE.8.2.2 of the Jakarta EE {tck_version} platform specification and section 20.2.0.1 in the Jakarta Connectors (formerly JCA) 1.7 specification, which explicitly state that the resource adapter server may employ the library mechanisms in Jakarta EE {tck_version}.

* Support application-based standalone connector accessibility +
Section 20.2.0.4 of the Jakarta Connectors (formerly JCA) 1.7 Specification uses the classloading
requirements that are listed in section 20.3 in the specification.

[[connector-resource-adapters-and-classloading]]
==== Connector Resource Adapters and Classloading

Jakarta EE {tck_version} Platform TCK has scenarios in which multiple standalone RAR files that use the same shared library (for example, `whitebox.jar`) are referenced from an application component.

Each standalone RAR file gets loaded in its own classloader. Since the application component refers to more than one standalone RAR file, all of the referenced standalone RAR files need to be made available in the classpath of the application component. In versions of the TCK prior to Java EE 5, since each standalone RAR file contained a copy of the `whitebox.jar` file, every time there was a reference to a class in the `whitebox.jar` file from a standalone RAR, the reference was resolved by using the private version of `whitebox.jar` (the `whitebox.jar` file was bundled in each standalone RAR file). This approach can lead to class type inconsistency issues.

[[use-case-problem-scenario]]

==== Use Case Problem Scenario

Assume that RAR1 and RAR2 are standalone RAR files that are referred to by an application, where:

* RAR1's classloader has access to RAR1's classes and its copy of `whitebox.jar`. (RAR1's classloader contains RAR1's classes and `whitebox.jar`)

* RAR2's classloader has access to RAR2's classes and its copy of `whitebox.jar`. (RAR2's classloader contains RAR2's classes and `whitebox.jar`)

When the application refers to both of these RAR files, a classloader that encompasses both of these classloaders (thereby creating a classloader search order) is provided to the application. The classloader search order could have the following sequence: ([RAR1's Classloader: RAR1's classes and whitebox.jar], [RAR2's Classloader: RAR2's classes and whitebox.jar]).

In this scenario, when an application loads a class (for example, class `Foo`) in `whitebox.jar`, the application gets class `Foo` from RAR1's classloader because that is first in the classloader search order.
However, when this is cast to a class (for example, `Foo` or a subclass of `Foo` or even a class that references `Foo`) that is obtained from RAR2's classloader (a sequence that is typically realized in a `ConnectionFactory` lookup), this would result in a class-cast exception.

The portable way of solving the issues raised by this use case problem scenario is to use installed libraries, as was described in section EE.8.2.2 in the Jakarta EE 10 platform specification. If both RAR files (RAR1 and RAR2) reference `whitebox.jar` as an installed library and the application server can use a single classloader to load this common dependency, there will be no type-related issues.

For Jakarta EE 11 and beyond, VI servers will need to configure the common `whitebox.jar` in whatever manner is supported by the server.

In the CI Eclipse {glassfish_version}, `domain-dir/lib/applibs` is used as the Installed Library directory and is the location to which the `whitebox.jar` file gets copied.

[[required-porting-package]]
==== Required Porting Package

The Jakarta EE {tck_version} Platform TCK test suite treats the `whitebox.jar` dependency as an Installed Library dependency instead of bundling the dependency (or dependencies) with every RAR file.

It is necessary to identify the `whitebox.jar` to the connector server as an installed library. Because the `whitebox.jar` file depends on Jakarta EE APIs, one cannot simply put the `whitebox.jar` file into a `java.ext.dir` directory , which gets loaded by the VM extension classloader, because that mechanism does not allow the `whitebox.jar` file to support its dependencies on the Jakarta EE APIs. For this reason, the common `whitebox.jar` must support access to the Jakarta EE APIs.

[[creating-security-mappings--connector-rar-files]]
==== Creating Security Mappings for the Connector RAR Files (Full Platform Only)

The VI server needs to map Resource Adapter user information to existing user information in the CI.

For the Eclipse {glassfish_version} CI, the required mappings add a line to the `domain.xml` file, similar to the one shown below, and should include 6 of these mappings:

[source,properties]
----
<jvm-options>-Dwhitebox-tx-map=cts1=j2ee</jvm-options>
<jvm-options>-Dwhitebox-tx-param-map=cts1=j2ee</jvm-options>
<jvm-options>-Dwhitebox-notx-map=cts1=j2ee</jvm-options>
<jvm-options>-Dwhitebox-notx-param-map=cts1=j2ee</jvm-options>
<jvm-options>-Dwhitebox-xa-map=cts1=j2ee</jvm-options>
<jvm-options>-Dwhitebox-xa-param-map=cts1=j2ee</jvm-options>
----

If the `rauser1` property has been set to `cts1` and the `user` property has been set to `j2ee` in the `ts.jte` file, the following mappings would be required in the connector runtime:

* For RA `whitebox-tx`, map `cts1` to `j2ee`
* For RA `whitebox-tx-param`, map `cts1` to `j2ee`
* For RA `whitebox-notx`, map `cts1` to `j2ee`
* For RA `whitebox-notx-param`, map `cts1` to `j2ee`
* For RA `whitebox-xa`, map `cts1` to `j2ee`
* For RA `whitebox-xa-param`, map `cts1` to `j2ee`

[[creating-required-server-side-jvm-options]]
==== Creating Required Server-Side JVM Options

Create the required JVM options that enable user information to be set and/or passed from the `ts.jte` file to the server. The RAR files use some of the property settings in the `ts.jte` file.

To see some of the required JVM options for the server under test, see the `s1as.jvm.options` property in the `ts.jte` file. The connector tests require that the following subset of JVM options be set in the server under test:

[source,bash]
----
-Dj2eelogin.name=j2ee
-Dj2eelogin.password=j2ee
-Deislogin.name=cts1
-Deislogin.password=cts1
----

[[xa-test-setup]]
=== XA Test Setup

The XA Test setup requires that the `ejb_Tsr.ear` file be deployed as part of the `config.vi` Ant target. The `ejb_Tsr.ear` file contains an
embedded RAR file, which requires the creation of a connection-pool and
a connector resource.

For more details about the deployment of `ejb_Tsr.ear` and its
corresponding connection pool and connector resource values, see the
`setup.tsr.embedded.rar` Ant target in the
`<TS_HOME>/bin/xml/impl/glassfish/s1as.xml` file.

The XA tests reference some `JDBCWhitebox` name bindings that are
created as part of the `config.vi` target but those name bindings are
not tied to any JDBC RAR files. Instead, the following XA-specific
connection pool ids are referenced by the XA tests:

* `eis/JDBCwhitebox-xa`
* `eis/JDBCwhitebox-tx`
* `eis/JDBCwhitebox-notx`

For more details on these JDBC resources, examine the
`add.jdbc.resources` target in the same file to see the required JDBC
resources that are created. Both targets are called as part of the
`config.vi` target.

Complete the following steps (create JDBC connection pools and JDBC
resource elements, deploy the RAR files) to set up your environment to
run the XA tests:

.  Create a JDBC connection pool with the following attributes:

* Set the resource type to `javax.sql.XADataSource`

* Set the datasourceclassname to
`org.apache.derby.jdbc.EmbeddedXADataSource`

* Set the property to
`DatabaseName=<Derby-location>:user=cts1:password=cts1`

* Set the connection pool name to `cts-derby-XA-pool` +
For example, you could use the `asadmin` command line utility in the
Jakarta EE {tck_version} CI, Eclipse GlassFish 6.1 to create this connection pool:
+
[source,bash]
----
asadmin create-jdbc-connection-pool --restype javax.sql.XADataSource \
--datasourceclassname org.apache.derby.jdbc.EmbeddedXADataSource  \
--property 'DatabaseName=/tmp/DerbyDB:user=cts1:password=cts1' \
cts-derby-XA-pool
----
+

.  Create three JDBC connection pool elements (more specifically, the
JDBC connection pool elements) with the following JNDI names:

* For the first connection pool element, set the connection pool id to
`cts-derby-XA-pool` and the JNDI name to `eis/JDBCwhitebox-xa`

* For the second connection pool element, set the connection pool id to
`cts-derby-XA-pool` and the JNDI name to `eis/JDBCwhitebox-tx`

* For the third connection pool element, set the connection pool id to
`cts-derby-XA-pool` and the JNDI name to `eis/JDBCwhitebox-notx` +
For example, you could use the `asadmin` command line utility in the
Jakarta EE {tck_version} CI to create the three connection pool elements:
+
[source,bash]
----
asadmin  asadmin  create-jdbc-resource --connectionpoolid cts-derby-XA-pool \
 eis/JDBCwhitebox-xa
asadmin  create-jdbc-resource --connectionpoolid cts-derby-XA-pool \
 eis/JDBCwhitebox-tx
asadmin  create-jdbc-resource --connectionpoolid cts-derby-XA-pool \
 eis/JDBCwhitebox-notx
----
+
If two or more JDBC resource elements point to the same connection pool
element, they use the same pool connection at runtime. Jakarta EE {tck_version} Platform TCK
does reuse the same connection pool ID for testing the Jakarta EE {tck_version} CI Eclipse {glassfish_version}.

.  Make sure that the following EIS and RAR files have been deployed
into your environment before you run the XA tests:

* For the EIS resource adapter, deploy the following RAR files. Most of these files are standalone RAR files, but there is also an embedded RAR file that is contained in the `ejb_Tsr.ear` file. With the CI runner these files are deployed as part of . The following `ts.jte` properties refer to the required common RAR files and define the JNDI bindings for the RAR connection factory as deployed by the VI server deployments.
+
[source,properties]
----
whitebox-tx=java:comp/env/eis/whitebox-tx
whitebox-notx=java:comp/env/eis/whitebox-notx
whitebox-xa=java:comp/env/eis/whitebox-xa

----
+
* The embedded RAR files are located in the
`<TS_HOME>/src/com/sun/ts/tests/xa/ee/tsr` directory.

* The EIS RAR files are located TCK distribution artifacts directory. Deployment can either be done ahead of time or at runtime, as long as connection pools and resources are established prior to test execution. +
The XA tests make use of existing connector RAR files. Note that there are currently no `JDBCwhitebox` source files and no `JDNCwhitebox` RAR files.

[[jakarta-enterprise-beans-4-test-setup]]
=== Jakarta Enterprise Beans 4.0 Test Setup

This section explains special configuration that needs to be completed
before running the Jakarta Enterprise Beans 4.0 DataSource and Stateful Timeout tests.

The Jakarta Enterprise Beans 4.0 DataSource tests do not test XA capability and XA support in
a database product is typically not required for these tests. However,
some Jakarta EE products could be implemented in such a way that XA must be
supported by the database. For example, when processing the
@DataSourceDefinition annotation or `<data-source>` descriptor elements
in tests, a Jakarta EE product infers the datasource type from the
interface implemented by the driver class. When the driver class
implements multiple interfaces, such as `javax.sql.DataSource`,
`javax.sql.ConnectionPoolDataSource`, or `javax.sql.XADataSource`, the
vendor must choose which datasource type to use. If
`javax.sql.XADataSource` is chosen, the target datasource system must be
configured to support XA. Consult the documentation for your database
system and JDBC driver for information that explains how to enable XA
support.

[[configure-the-tests-ejb-datasource-tests]]
==== To Configure the Test Environment to Run the Jakarta Enterprise Beans 4.0 DataSource Tests

The EJB 3.2 DataSource tests under the following `jakarta.tck:ejb30` artifact packages may require you to update the  `@DataSourceDefinition` used in the test class to match your database environment. You are allowed to recompile these tests with those changes before running them.

* `com/sun/ts/tests/ejb30/lite/packaging/war/datasource`
* `com/sun/ts/tests/ejb30/misc/datasource`
* `com/sun/ts/tests/ejb30/assembly/appres`

If your database vendor requires you to set any vendor-specific or less
common DataSource properties, complete step <<jdbc.datasource.props>> and then complete step <<configure_datasource_tests>>, as explained below.

.  [[jdbc.datasource.props]] Set any vendor-specific or less common datasource properties with the
`jdbc.datasource.props` property in the `ts.jte` file. +
The value of the property is a comma-separated array of name-value
pairs, in which each property pair uses a `"name=value"` format,
including the surrounding double quotes. +
The value of the property must not contain any extra spaces. +
For example: 
+
[source,properties]
----
jdbc.datasource.props="driverType=thin","name2=vale2"
----
+
.  [[configure_datasource_tests]] Run the `configure.datasource.tests` Ant target to rebuild the Jakarta Enterprise Beans 4.0
DataSource Definition tests using the new database settings specified in
the `ts.jte` file. +
This step must be completed for Jakarta EE {tck_version} and Jakarta EE {tck_version} Web Profile
testing.

[[configure-tests-ejb-stateful-timeout-tests]]
==== To Configure the Test Environment to Run the Jakarta Enterprise Beans 4.0 Stateful Timeout Tests
The Jakarta Enterprise Beans 4.0 Stateful Timeout Tests in the following `jakarta.tck:ejb30` artifact test directories require special setup:

* `com/sun/ts/tests/ejb30/lite/stateful/timeout`
* `com/sun/ts/tests/ejb30/bb/session/stateful/timeout`

.  Set the `javatest.timeout.factor` property in the `ts.jte` file to a
value such that the JavaTest harness does not time out before the test
completes. +
A value of 2.0 or greater should be sufficient.

.  Set the `test.ejb.stateful.timeout.wait.seconds` property, which
specifies the minimum amount of time, in seconds, that the test client
waits before verifying the status of the target stateful bean, to a
value that is appropriate for your server. +
The value of this property must be an integer number. The default value
is 480 seconds. This value can be set to a smaller number (for example,
240 seconds) to speed up testing, depending on the stateful timeout
implementation strategy in the target server.

[[ejb-timer-test-setup]]
=== Jakarta Enterprise Beans Timer Test Setup

Set the following properties in the `ts.jte` file to configure the Jakarta Enterprise Beans timer tests:

[source,properties]
----
ejb_timeout=[interval_in_milliseconds]
ejb_wait=[interval_in_milliseconds]
----

* The `ejb_timeout` property sets the duration of single-event and
interval timers. The default setting and recommended minimum value is
`30000` milliseconds.
* The `ejb_wait` property sets the period for the test client to wait
for results from the `ejbTimeout()` method. The default setting and
recommended minimum value is `60000` milliseconds.

Jakarta EE {tck_version} Platform TCK does not have a property that you can set to configure the date for date timers.

The timer tests use the specific `jndi-name` jdbc`/DBTimer` for the
datasource used for container-managed persistence to support the use of
an XA datasource in the Jakarta EE {tck_version} timer implementation. For example:

[source,xml]
----
<jdbc-resource enabled="true" jndi-name="jdbc/DBTimer" 
               object-type="user" pool-name="cts-javadb-XA-pool" />
----

The test directories that use this datasource are:

[source,bash]
----
ejb/ee/timer
ejb/ee/bb/entity/bmp/allowedmethostest
ejb/ee/bb/entity/cmp20/allowedmethodstest
----

When testing against the Jakarta Platform, Enterprise Edition CI, Eclipse {glassfish_version}, you must
first start the Derby DB and initialize it in addition to any other database you may be using, as explained in <<configuring-the-java-ee-ci-as-the-vi>>


[[jakarta-persistence-api-test-setup]]
=== Jakarta Persistence API Test Setup

The Jakarta Persistence API tests exercise the requirements as defined in
the Jakarta Persistence API Specification. This specification defines a
persistence context to be a set of managed entity instances, in which
for any persistent identity there is a unique entity instance. Within
the persistence context, the entity instances and their life cycles are
managed by the entity manager.

Within a Jakarta Platform, Enterprise Edition environment, support for both
container-managed and application-managed entity managers is required.
Application-managed entity managers can be Jakarta Transactions or resource-local. Refer
to Chapter 7 of the Jakarta Persistence API Specification
(`https://jakarta.ee/specifications/persistence/3.2`) for additional information regarding entity managers.

[NOTE]
====
There are tests that install a custom Jakarta Persistence provider in the Jakarta Persistence API tests. The tests expect that the log.file.location from the ts.jte file has been propagated to a system property in the server environment. Normally this is automatically done by the TCK harness, but if  your Jakarta Persistence integration causes the custom `jakarta.persistence.spi.PersistenceProvider` or `jakarta.persistence.spi.ProviderUtil` to initialize before the TCK harness, you may need to set the system property manually in the container configuration. If this is not set, it will default to a temporary file in the `java.io.tmpdir' and any setting for log.file.location in the ts.jte will be ignored in favor of the temporary file.
====

[[configure-jpa-pluggability-tests]]
==== To Configure the Test Environment to Run the Jakarta Persistence Pluggability Tests

The Jakarta Persistence Pluggability tests under the
`src/tcks/apis/persistence/persistence-inside-container/platform-tests/src/main/java/ee/jakarta/tck/persistence/ee/pluggability` directory ensure that a third-party persistence provider is pluggable, in nature.

After Java EE 7 TCK, the pluggability tests were rewritten to use a
stubbed-out legacy JPA 2.1 implementation, which is located in the
`src/tcks/apis/persistence/persistence-inside-container/common/src/main/java/ee/jakarta/tck/persistence/common/pluggability/altprovider` directory.

In Java EE 7 TCK, the Persistence API pluggability tests required
special setup to run. This is no longer the case, since Jakarta EE {tck_version} Platform TCK now enables the pluggability tests to be executed automatically along with all the other Persistence tests.

[[sthref19]][[enabling-second-level-caching-support]]

==== Enabling Second Level Caching Support

Jakarta Persistence supports the use of a second-level cache by the
persistence provider. The `ts.jte` file provides a property that
controls the TCK test suite's use of the second-level cache.

The `persistence.second.level.caching.supported` property is used to
determine if the persistence provider supports the use of a second-level
cache. The default value is true. If your persistence provider does not
support second level caching, set the value to false.

[[persistence-test-vehicles]]
==== Persistence Test Vehicles

The persistence tests are run in a variety of "vehicles" from which the entity manager is obtained and the transaction type is defined for use. There are six vehicles used for these tests:

* `stateless3`: Bean-managed stateless session bean using
a Jakarta Transactions `EntityManager`; uses UserTransaction` methods for transaction demarcation  (Full Platform Only)

* `stateful3`: Container-managed stateful session bean using
`@PersistenceContext` annotation to inject Jakarta Transactions `EntityManager;` uses container-managed transaction demarcation with a transaction attribute (required)  (Full Platform Only)

* `appmanaged`: Container-managed stateful session bean using `@PersistenceUnit` annotation to inject an `EntityManagerFactory`; the `EntityManagerFactory` API is used to create an Application-Managed Jakarta Transactions `EntityManager`, and uses the container to demarcate transactions (Full Platform Only)

* `appmanagedNoTx`: Container-managed stateful session bean using `@PersistenceUnit` annotation to inject an `EntityManagerFactory`; the `EntityManagerFactory` API is used to create an Application-Managed Resource Local `EntityManager`, and uses the `EntityTransaction` APIs to control transactions (Full Platform Only)

* `pmservlet`: Servlet that uses the `@PersistenceContext` annotation at the class level and then uses JNDI lookup to obtain the `EntityManager`; alternative to declaring the persistence context dependency via a `persistence-context-ref` in `web.xml` and uses `UserTransaction` methods for transaction demarcation

* `puservlet`: Servlet that injects an `EntityManagerFactory` using the `@PersistenceUnit` annotation to create a to Resource Local `EntityManager`, and uses `EntityTransaction` APIs for transaction demarcation

* none: There are a new tests that do not use the EE10 vehicle concept. Rather they make use of existing Arquillian protocols based on servlets or rest endpoints.

[NOTE]
======

For vehicles using a `RESOURCE_LOCAL` transaction type, be sure to configure a non-transactional resource with the logical name `jdbc/DB_no_tx`. Refer to the `ts.jte` file for information about the `jdbc.db` property.

======


[[generatedvalue-annotation]]
==== GeneratedValue Annotation

The Jakarta Persistence API Specification also defines the requirements for the `GeneratedValue` annotation. The default for this annotation is
`GenerationType.AUTO`. Per the specification, `AUTO` indicates that the
persistence provider should pick an appropriate strategy for the
particular database. The `AUTO` generation strategy may expect a
database resource to exist, or it may attempt to create one.

The `db.supports.sequence` property is used to determine if a database
supports the use of SEQUENCE. If it does not, this property should be
set to false so the test is not run. The default value is true.

If the database under test is not one of the databases defined and
supported by TCK, the user will need to create an entry similar to the one listed in <<genvalue-annotation-example>>.

[[genvalue-annotation-example]]
==== Example 5-1 GeneratedValue Annotation Test Table

[source,sql]
----
DROP TABLE SEQUENCE;
CREATE TABLE SEQUENCE (SEQ_NAME VARCHAR(10), SEQ_COUNT INT, CONSTRAINT SEQUENCE_PK /
PRIMARY KEY (SEQ_NAME) );
INSERT into SEQUENCE(SEQ_NAME, SEQ_COUNT) values ('SEQ_GEN', 0) ;
----

You should add your own table to your chosen database DDL file provided
prior to running these tests.

The `persistence.xml` file, which defines a persistence unit, contains
the `unitName` `CTS-EM` for Jakarta Transactions entity managers. This corresponds to
`jta-data-source`, `jdbc/DB1`, and to `CTS-EM-NOTX` for `RESOURCE_LOCAL`
entity managers, which correspond to a `non-jta-data-source`
`jdbc/DB_no_tx`.

[NOTE]
======================================================================

Implementations of `TSJMSAdminInterface` are called inside the JavaTest
VM. (Obsolete, need to define if this is used and how)

======================================================================


[[jakarta-ejb-endpoint-security]]
==== Jakarta Enterprise Beans Endpoint Security

[source,bash]
----
element : login-config
----

This only applies to Jakarta Enterprise Beans endpoints and is optional. It is used to
specify how authentication is performed for Jakarta Enterprise Beans endpoint invocations. It
consists of a single subelement named `auth-method`. `auth-method` is
set to `BASIC` or `CLIENT_CERT`. The equivalent security for servlet
endpoints is set through the standard web-application security elements.
For example:

[source,xml]
----
<ejb>
      <ejb-name>GoogleEjb</ejb-name>
      <webservice-endpoint>
        <port-component-name>GoogleSearchPort</port-component-name>
        <endpoint-address-uri>google/GoogleSearch</endpoint-address-uri>

        <login-config>
           <auth-method>BASIC</auth-method>
        </login-config>
      </webservice-endpoint>
</ejb>
----

[[transport-guarantee]]
==== Transport Guarantee

[source,bash]
----
element : transport-guarantee
----

This is an optional setting on `webservice-endpoint`. The allowable
values are `NONE`, `INTEGRAL`, and `CONFIDENTIAL`. If not specified, the
behavior is equivalent to `NONE`. The meaning of each option is the same
as is defined in the Security chapter of the Jakarta Servlet 6.0 Specification. 
This setting will determine the
scheme and port used to generate the final endpoint address for a web
service endpoint. For `NONE`, the scheme will be `HTTP` and port will be
the default HTTP port. For `INTEGRAL/CONFIDENTIAL`, the scheme will be
`HTTPS` and the port will be the default HTTPS port.

[[signature-test-setup]]
=== Signature Test Setup

The signature test setup includes the following:

[[signature-test-vm-properties]]
==== Signature Test JVM Arguments

The following JVM arguments are required for the signature tests:

* `--add-exports=java.base/jdk.internal.vm.annotation=ALL-UNNAMED`

[[sigtestclasspath-property]]
==== sigTestClasspath Property

Set the `sigTestClasspath` property in the `<TS_HOME>/bin/ts.jte` file
to include a `CLASSPATH` containing the following:

[source,properties]
----
sigTestClasspath=jar_to_test:jars_used_by_yours 
----

where:

* ``jar_to_test``: The JAR file you are validating when running the
signature tests; when running against the Jakarta Platform, Enterprise
Edition CI, Eclipse GlassFish 6.1, set to `javaee.jar`

* ``jars_used_by_yours``: The JAR file or files that are used or referenced
by your JAR file; must include any classes that might be extended or
implemented by the classes in your jar_to_test; include `rt.jar` when
running against the Jakarta Platform, Enterprise Edition CI

[[javaee-level-property]]
==== javaee.level Property

Set the `javaee.level` property in the `<TS_HOME/bin/ts.jte` file to set the
profile to run. For example `platform` for the full platform or `web` for the
web profile.

[[optional-tech-packages-to-ignore-property]]
==== optional.tech.packages.to.ignore Property

Set the `optional.tech.packages.to.ignore` property in the `<TS_HOME/bin/ts.jte` file to set the
a comma delimited list of packages to ignore that are optionally available in the distribution.
For example, for the web profile, you may need to exclude the `jakarta.mail` packages.

[[bindir-property]]
==== bin.dir Property

Set the `bin.dir` property in the `<TS_HOME>/bin/ts.jte` file to set the path where
the signature mapping and package list files are located. Typically you'd extract the files from the test
archive.

[[additional-signature-test-information]]
==== Additional Signature Test Information

The Jakarta EE {tck_version} Platform TCK signature tests perform verifications in two different
modes: static and reflection. The test results list which SPEC API signature
tests pass or fail, and the mode (static or reflection) for that test.

Any signature test failure means one of two things, either you have not yet
corrected the `sigTestClasspath` or the respective SPEC API  jar in your Jakarta EE
implementation needs a modification to exactly match the Jakarta EE {tck_version} Platform SPEC API.
Your implementation SPEC API jars cannot contain additional public methods/fields,
nor can it be missing any expected public methods/fields.

As a troubleshooting aid when failures occur, consider the following:

* All static mode tests fail: +
Verify that the `sigTestClasspath` is using correct  SPEC API file names.
When running on Windows, be sure to use semicolons (`;`) for `CLASSPATH` separators.

* For all other signature test failures: +
Check the report output from the test to determine which tests failed
and why.

For example, some failures from an actual failure:

[source,text]
----
SVR: ********** Status Report 'jakarta.servlet.jsp.jstl.core' **********

SVR: SignatureTest report
Base version: 2.0_se11
Tested version: 2.0_se11
Check mode: src [throws normalized]
Constant checking: on

Missing Fields :

jakarta.servlet.jsp.jstl.core.Config:   field public final static java.lang.String jakarta.servlet.jsp.jstl.core.Config.FMT_FALLBACK_LOCALE = "jakarta.servlet.jsp.jstl.fmt.fallbackLocale"
jakarta.servlet.jsp.jstl.core.Config:   field public final static java.lang.String jakarta.servlet.jsp.jstl.core.Config.FMT_LOCALE = "jakarta.servlet.jsp.jstl.fmt.locale"
jakarta.servlet.jsp.jstl.core.Config:   field public final static java.lang.String jakarta.servlet.jsp.jstl.core.Config.FMT_LOCALIZATION_CONTEXT = "jakarta.servlet.jsp.jstl.fmt.localizationContext"
jakarta.servlet.jsp.jstl.core.Config:   field public final static java.lang.String jakarta.servlet.jsp.jstl.core.Config.FMT_TIME_ZONE = "jakarta.servlet.jsp.jstl.fmt.timeZone"
jakarta.servlet.jsp.jstl.core.Config:   field public final static java.lang.String jakarta.servlet.jsp.jstl.core.Config.SQL_DATA_SOURCE = "jakarta.servlet.jsp.jstl.sql.dataSource"
jakarta.servlet.jsp.jstl.core.Config:   field public final static java.lang.String jakarta.servlet.jsp.jstl.core.Config.SQL_MAX_ROWS = "jakarta.servlet.jsp.jstl.sql.maxRows"

Added Fields :

jakarta.servlet.jsp.jstl.core.Config:   field public final static java.lang.String jakarta.servlet.jsp.jstl.core.Config.FMT_FALLBACK_LOCALE = "javax.servlet.jsp.jstl.fmt.fallbackLocale"
jakarta.servlet.jsp.jstl.core.Config:   field public final static java.lang.String jakarta.servlet.jsp.jstl.core.Config.FMT_LOCALE = "javax.servlet.jsp.jstl.fmt.locale"
jakarta.servlet.jsp.jstl.core.Config:   field public final static java.lang.String jakarta.servlet.jsp.jstl.core.Config.FMT_LOCALIZATION_CONTEXT = "javax.servlet.jsp.jstl.fmt.localizationContext"
jakarta.servlet.jsp.jstl.core.Config:   field public final static java.lang.String jakarta.servlet.jsp.jstl.core.Config.FMT_TIME_ZONE = "javax.servlet.jsp.jstl.fmt.timeZone"
jakarta.servlet.jsp.jstl.core.Config:   field public final static java.lang.String jakarta.servlet.jsp.jstl.core.Config.SQL_DATA_SOURCE = "javax.servlet.jsp.jstl.sql.dataSource"
jakarta.servlet.jsp.jstl.core.Config:   field public final static java.lang.String jakarta.servlet.jsp.jstl.core.Config.SQL_MAX_ROWS = "javax.servlet.jsp.jstl.sql.maxRows"

SVR: ********** Package 'jakarta.servlet.jsp.jstl.core' - FAILED (STATIC MODE) **********
----

The failure above is a little strange, isn't it?  Why are there missing fields?  Why are there added fields?
The failure means that the `jakarta.servlet.jsp.jstl.core.Config` class needs to be updated to assign the correct values to the indicated constant fields.  
Basically, instead of setting `Config.FMT_FALLBACK_LOCALE = "javax.servlet.jsp.jstl.fmt.fallbackLocale"`,  you should set `Config.FMT_FALLBACK_LOCALE = "jakarta.servlet.jsp.jstl.fmt.fallbackLocale"`
The same correction is needed for the other identified fields as well.

Another example only with methods is:

[source,text]
----
SVR: ********** Status Report 'jakarta.el' **********

SVR: SignatureTest report
Base version: 4.0_se11
Tested version: 4.0_se11

jakarta.el.StandardELContext:           method public void jakarta.el.StandardELContext.putContext(java.lang.Class<?>,java.lang.Object)

Added Methods :

jakarta.el.ELContext:                   method public java.lang.Object jakarta.el.ELContext.getContext(java.lang.Class)
jakarta.el.ELContext:                   method public void jakarta.el.ELContext.putContext(java.lang.Class,java.lang.Object)
jakarta.el.StandardELContext:           method public java.lang.Object jakarta.el.StandardELContext.getContext(java.lang.Class)
jakarta.el.StandardELContext:           method public void jakarta.el.StandardELContext.putContext(java.lang.Class,java.lang.Object)
----

The failure above is a little strange, isn't it?  Why are there missing  methods?  Why are there added methods?
The failure means that the `java.lang.Object jakarta.el.ELContext.getContext(java.lang.Class)` method needs a signature change 
from `getContext(Class key)` to `getContext(Class<?> key)`.  The same correction is needed for the other identified methods as well.

IMPORTANT: In the above example the `signature.file.dir` has a `src` directory prefix which is important. Currently
the path for the signature test files is `src/com/sun/ts/tests/signaturetest/tests/signaturetest/` and is hard-coded.
This may change in a future release to not require such a property be set.


[[backend-database-setup]]
== Backend Database Setup

The following sections address special backend database setup
considerations:

* <<setup-considerations-for-mysql>>
* <<setup-considerations-for-ms-sql-server>>

[[setup-considerations-for-mysql]]
=== Setup Considerations for MySQL

The Jakarta Persistence API (formerly JPA) tests require delimited identifiers for
the native query tests. If you are using delimited identifiers on MySQL,
modify the `sql-mode` setting in the `my.cnf` file to set the
ANSI_QUOTES option. After setting this option, reboot the MySQL server.
Set the option as shown in this example:

[source,properties]
----
sql-mode="STRICT_TRANS_TABLES,NO_AUTO_CREATE_USER,NO_ENGINE_SUBSTITUTION,ANSI_QUOTES"
----

[[setup-considerations-for-ms-sql-server]]
=== Setup Considerations for MS SQL Server

If your database already exists and if you use a case-sensitive
collation on MS SQL Server, execute the following command to modify the
database and avert errors caused by case-sensitive collation:

[source,sql]
----
ALTER DATABASE ctsdb
COLLATE Latin1_General_CS_AS ;
