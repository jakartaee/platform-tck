Porting Package Directory README
--------------------------------

This directory contains classes that abstract any implementation-specific 
code.  The current implementations of these classes use the semantics of 
Sun's Java EE Reference Implementation.  Licensees can modify and rebuild these 
classes to work with their particular implementation of the Java EE platform.

Please see the "Porting Package" section of the TS User's Guide (section 9.2)
for more information.
