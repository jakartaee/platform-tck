# Security Policy

Jakarta EE Platform TCK follows the [Eclipse Vulnerability Reporting Policy](https://www.eclipse.org/security/policy.php). Vulnerabilities are tracked by the Eclipse security team, in cooperation with the Jakarta EE Platform TCK [project lead](https://projects.eclipse.org/projects/ee4j.jakartaee-tck/who). Fixing vulnerabilities is taken care of by the Jakarta EE Platform TCK project committers, with assistance and guidance of the security team. 

## Supported Versions

Jakarta EE Platform TCK supports security updates for the following releases:

| Version | Supported          |
| ------- | ------------------ |

| < 9.0   | :x:                |

## Reporting a Vulnerability

We recommend that in case of suspected vulnerabilities you do not use the Jakarta EE Platform TCK public issue tracker, but instead contact the Eclipse Security Team directly via security@eclipse.org.
