= A Common Applications Deployment (Needs Rewrite)

TODO: figure out if Common Applications Deployment tests should be removed since they cannot rely on (removed) Jakarta Deployment in EE 9.

Some tests in the test suite require the deployment of additional
applications, components, or resource archives that are located in
directories other than the test's directory.

<<required-common-applications>> lists the test directories and the directories
that contain the common applications that are required by the test
directories.
