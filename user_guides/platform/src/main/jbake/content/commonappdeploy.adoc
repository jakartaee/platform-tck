A Common Applications Deployment
--------------------------------

TODO: figure out if Common Applications Deployment tests should be removed since they cannot rely on (removed) Jakarta Deployment in EE 9.

Some tests in the test suite require the deployment of additional
applications, components, or resource archives that are located in
directories other than the test's directory. When the test harness
encounters a test that requires these additional applications,
components, or resource archives, they are passed to the
`TSDeploymentInterface2` implementation to be deployed. Because these
applications can be shared by tests in different test directories, they
are called common applications.

link:#GFAXX[Table A-1] lists the test directories and the directories
that contain the common applications that are required by the test
directories.
