[NOTE]
========================================================================

The Jakarta Enterprise Edition documentation is part of the Jakarta Enterprise 
Edition contribution to the Eclipse Foundation and is not intended for 
use in relation to Java Enterprise Edition or Java Licensee 
requirements. This documentation is in the process of being revised to 
reflect the new Jakarta EE requirements and branding. 
Additional changes will be made as requirements and procedures evolve 
for Jakarta EE. Where applicable, references to Java EE or Java 
Enterprise Edition should be considered references to Jakarta EE. 

Please see the Title page for additional license information.
========================================================================

This book introduces the Test Compatibility Kit (TCK) for the Jakarta
Platform, Enterprise Edition 11 (Jakarta EE 11) and Jakarta Platform, Enterprise
Edition 11 Web Profile (Jakarta EE 11 Web Profile), and explains how to
configure and run the test suite. It also provides information for
troubleshooting problems you may encounter as you run the test suite.

The Jakarta Platform, Enterprise Edition 11 Test Compatibility Kit (Jakarta
EE 11 TCK) is a portable, configurable automated test suite for verifying
the compatibility of an implementer's compliance with the Jakarta EE 11
Specification (hereafter referred to as the implementer's implementation, or VI).
The Jakarta EE 11 Platform TCK uses the JavaTest harness version 5.0 to run the
test suite.
