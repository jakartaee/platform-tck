4 Installation
--------------

This chapter explains how to install the Jakarta EE 9 Platform TCK software and
perform a sample test run to verify your installation and familiarize
yourself with the TCK. Installation instructions are provided for Eclipse
GlassFish 6.0, a Compatible Implementation (CI) of Jakarta EE. If you are using
another compatible implementation, refer to instructions provided with that
implementation.

After installing the software according to the instructions in this
chapter, proceed to link:config.html#GBFVV[Chapter 5, "Setup and
Configuration,"] for instructions on configuring your test environment.

This chapter covers the following topics:

* link:#GEVGN[Installing the Jakarta EE 9 Compatible Implementation]
* link:#GEVHP[Installing the Jakarta EE 9 Platform TCK]
* link:#GEVGZ[Verifying Your Installation (Optional)]

4.1 Installing the Jakarta EE 9 Compatible Implementation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

[[sthref14]]

==== Before You Begin

If a Jakarta EE 9 Compatible Implementation (CI) is already installed, it
is recommended that you shut it down and start with a new, clean CI
installation.

1.  Install the Java SE 8 JDK bundle, if it is not already installed. +
Refer to the JDK installation instructions for details. The JDK bundle
can be downloaded from
`http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html`
2.  Create or change to the directory in which you will install the Jakarta
EE 9 CI.
3.  Copy or download the Jakarta EE 9 CI, for example, Eclipse GlassFish 6.0.
4.  Unzip the Jakarta EE 9 CI bundle.
5.  For Eclipse GlassFish 6.0, set the following environment variables:
* `JAVAEE_HOME` to the CI directory you just created
* `JAVA_HOME` to the JDK you want to use
6.  Start the Jakarta EE 9 CI, Eclipse GlassFish 6.0, by executing the following command: +
[source,oac_no_warn]
----
<JAVAEE_HOME>/bin/asadmin start-domain
----

4.2 Installing the Jakarta EE 9 Platform TCK
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Complete the following procedure to install the Jakarta EE 9 Platform TCK on a
system running the Solaris, Linux, or Windows operating system.


[NOTE]
=======================================================================

When installing in the Windows environment, the Jakarta EE 9 CI, Java SE 8
JDK, and TCK should be installed on the same drive. If you must install
these components on different drives, be sure to change the
`ri.applicationRoot` and `s1as.applicationRoot` properties as needed in
the `<TS_HOME>/bin/ts.jte` TCK configuration file. See
link:config.html#GEXOS[Section 5.4.2, "Windows-Specific Properties,"] for
more information.

=======================================================================


.  Copy or download the TCK 9 software.
.  Change to the directory in which you want to install the Jakarta EE 9
TCK software and use the `unzip` command to extract the bundle: 
+
[source,oac_no_warn]
----
cd install_directory
unzip jakartaeetck-nnn.zip
----
+
This creates the `jakartaeetck` directory. The
install_directory`/jakartaeetck` directory will be `TS_HOME`.
.  Set the `TS_HOME` environment variable to point to the `javaeetck`
directory.

After you complete the installation, follow the directions in
link:config.html#GBFVV[Chapter 5, "Setup and Configuration,"] to set up
and configure the Jakarta EE 9 Platform TCK test suite.

[[GEVGZ]][[verifying-your-installation-optional]]

4.3 Verifying Your Installation (Optional)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This procedure is optional. After installing the Jakarta EE 9 CI and Jakarta
EE 9 TCK, you may want to verify your installation by running the TCK
samples against the Jakarta EE 9 CI. See link:config.html#GBFVV[Chapter 5,
"Setup and Configuration,"] for complete configuration instructions.

.  For the Jakarta EE 9 CI, Eclipse GlassFish 6.0, set the following properties in your `<TS_HOME>/bin/ts.jte` file: 
+
[source,oac_no_warn]
----
javaee.home=<JAVAEE_HOME>
javaee.home.ri=<JAVAEE_HOME>
mailHost=<mail-server-host> // the name of an accessible SMTP server
mailuser1=firstname.lastname@xyz.com // a valid email address
mail.password=password // password for mailuser1
orb.host=localhost // the name of the machine running the Jakarta EE 9 CI
orb.host.ri=localhost // the name of the machine running the Jakarta EE 9 CI
----
+
.  Use these commands to run the Jakarta EE 9 Platform TCK sample tests: 
+
[source,oac_no_warn]
----
cd <TS_HOME>/bin
ant start.javadb.asadmin
ant config.vi
cd <TS_HOME>/src/com/sun/ts/tests/samples
ant runclient
