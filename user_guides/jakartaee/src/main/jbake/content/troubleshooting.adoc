----
The execution of the test will either fail or hang. +
Resolution: +
Set the `-Djavatest.maxOutputSize=`nnn system parameter in the
`runclient` and/or `gui` targets in the `<TS_HOME>/bin/build.xml` file
to a value that is higher than the default setting of `100,000` on the
JavaTest VM.

Set `JAVA_HOME` to the path where the version of Java being used was
installed and set `JAVAEE_HOME` to the location of the Jakarta Platform,
Enterprise Edition installation directory.
