6 Setup and Configuration for Testing with the Jakarta EE 9 Web Profile
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

This chapter describes how to configure the Jakarta EE 9 CTS test suite to
work with your Jakarta EE 9 Web Profile test environment. It is recommended
that you first set up the testing environment using the Jakarta EE 9 Web
Profile CI and then with your Jakarta EE 9 Web Profile server.

6.1 Configuring the Jakarta EE 9 Web Profile Test Environment
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The instructions in this section and in
link:config.html#GEWWA[Configuring Your Application Server as the VI]
step you through the configuration process for the Solaris, Microsoft
Windows, and Linux platforms.

6.1.1 To Run Tests Against a Jakarta EE 9 Web Profile Implementation
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The Jakarta EE 9 CTS is the Technology Compatibility Kit (TCK) for the Jakarta
Platform, Enterprise Edition as well as the Jakarta EE 9 Web Profile.
Implementations of the full Jakarta Platform, Enterprise Edition must pass
all of the tests as defined by Jakarta EE 9 CTS Rules in
link:rules.html#GBFSN[Chapter 2, "Procedure for Jakarta Platform, Enterprise
Edition 9 Certification"].

Implementations of the Jakarta EE 9 Web Profile must run the tests that
verify requirements defined by the Jakarta EE 9 Web Profile Specification.
These tests are defined by the Rules in link:rules-wp.html#GJJPZ[Chapter
3, "Procedure for Jakarta Platform, Enterprise Edition 9 Web Profile
Certification"]. These requirements are a subset of the tests contained
in the Jakarta EE 9 CTS test suite. The test suite provides a mechanism
whereby only those tests for the Jakarta EE 9 Web Profile will be run. The
following steps explain how to use this mechanism.

1.  Set the `javaee.level` property to `web` in the
`<TS_HOME>/bin/ts.jte` file. 
+
[source,oac_no_warn]
----
javaee.level=web
----
+
This setting will only allow WAR files (that is, no EAR files) to be
passed to the Deployment Porting Package. This is the minimal set of
signature requirements that vendors must support for Web Profile.
Specifying a javaee.level of "web" with nothing else implies there are
NO additional technologies existing within the vendors implementation.
Again, "web" only covers REQUIRED technologies for the Jakarta EE 9 Web
Profile.
2.  Set the `javaee_web_profile` keyword in one of the following ways:
* In batch mode, change to a test directory and execute the following
command: 
+
[source,oac_no_warn]
----
ant -Dkeywords=javaee_web_profile runclient 
----
+
Only tests that are required by the Jakarta EE 9 Web Profile will be run. +

[NOTE]
=======================================================================

If you start a test run in a test directory that contains no Jakarta EE 9
Web Profile tests, the test run will be aborted and the test harness
will report that no tests were found.

=======================================================================

* In the JavaTest GUI, open the test suite and perform the following
steps:
1.  Select View, then select Filters, then select CurrentConfiguration.
2.  Select Configure, then select ChangeConfiguration, then select
Keywords.
3.  In the Keywords dialog, select the Select Tests that Match check
box, specify the `javaee_web_profile` keyword in the field, then click
Done. +
Only those tests that are valid in the Jakarta EE 9 Web Profile will be
enabled in the test tree.
