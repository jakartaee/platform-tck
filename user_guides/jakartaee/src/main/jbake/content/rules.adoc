[[CJAFEGEH]][[rules-for-jakarta-platform-enterprise-edition-version-8-products]]

2.2.2 Rules for Jakarta Platform, Enterprise Edition Version 8 Products
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The following rules apply for each version of an operating system,
software component, and hardware platform Documented as supporting the
Product:

EE1 The Product must be able to satisfy all applicable compatibility
requirements, including passing all Conformance Tests, in every Product
Configuration and in every combination of Product Configurations, except
only as specifically exempted by these Rules.

For example, if a Product provides distinct Operating Modes to optimize
performance, then that Product must satisfy all applicable compatibility
requirements for a Product in each Product Configuration, and
combination of Product Configurations, of those Operating Modes.

EE1.1 If an Operating Mode controls a Resource necessary for the
basic execution of the Test Suite, testing may always use a Product
Configuration of that Operating Mode providing that Resource, even if
other Product Configurations do not provide that Resource.
Notwithstanding such exceptions, each Product must have at least one set
of Product Configurations of such Operating Modes that is able to pass
all the Conformance Tests.

For example, a Product with an Operating Mode that controls a security
policy (i.e., Security Resource) which has one or more Product
Configurations that cause Conformance Tests to fail may be tested using
a Product Configuration that allows all Conformance Tests to pass.

EE1.2 A Product Configuration of an Operating Mode that causes the
Product to report only version, usage, or diagnostic information is
exempted from these compatibility rules.

EE1.3 A Product may contain an Operating Mode that provides
compatibility with previous versions of the Product that would not
otherwise meet these compatibility requirements. At least the default
Product Configuration of this Operating Mode must meet these
compatibility requirements without invoking this rule; testing may
always use such a Product Configuration. This Operating Mode must affect
no smaller unit of execution than an entire Application. Any Product
Configuration that invokes this rule must be clearly Documented as not
meeting the requirements of the Specifications.

EE1.4 A Product may contain an Operating Mode that selects the
Edition with which it is compatible. The Product must meet the
compatibility requirements for the corresponding Edition for all Product
Configurations of this Operating Mode. This Operating Mode must affect
no smaller unit of execution than an entire Application.

EE1.5 An API Definition Product is exempt from all functional testing
requirements defined here, except the signature tests.

EE2 Some Conformance Tests may have properties that may be changed.
Properties that can be changed are identified in the configuration
interview. Properties that can be changed are identified in the JavaTest
Environment (.jte) files in the lib directory of the Test Suite
installation. Apart from changing such properties and other allowed
modifications described in this User's Guide (if any), no source or
binary code for a Conformance Test may be altered in any way without
prior written permission. Any such allowed alterations to the
Conformance Tests will be provided via the Jakarta EE Specification Project
website and apply to all vendor compatible implementations.

EE3 The testing tools supplied as part of the Test Suite or as
updated by the Maintenance Lead must be used to certify compliance.

EE4 The Exclude List associated with the Test Suite cannot be
modified.

EE5 The Maintenance Lead may define exceptions to these Rules. Such
exceptions would be made available as above, and will apply to all vendor implementations.

EE6 All hardware and software component additions, deletions, and
modifications to a Documented supporting hardware/software platform,
that are not part of the Product but required for the Product to satisfy
the compatibility requirements, must be Documented and available to
users of the Product.

For example, if a patch to a particular version of a supporting
operating system is required for the Product to pass the Conformance
Tests, that patch must be Documented and available to users of the
Product.

EE7 The Product must contain the full set of public and protected
classes and interfaces for all the Libraries. Those classes and
interfaces must contain exactly the set of public and protected methods,
constructors, and fields defined by the Specifications for those
Libraries. No subsetting, supersetting, or modifications of the public
and protected API of the Libraries are allowed except only as
specifically exempted by these Rules.

EE7.1 If a Product includes Technologies in addition to the
Technology Under Test, then it must contain the full set of combined
public and protected classes and interfaces. The API of the Product must
contain the union of the included Technologies. No further modifications
to the APIs of the included Technologies are allowed.

EE7.2 A Product may provide a newer version of an Endorsed Standard.
Upon request, the Maintenance Lead will make available alternate
Conformance Tests as necessary to conform with such newer version of an
Endorsed Standard. Such alternate tests will be made available to and
apply to all implementers. If a Product provides a newer version of an
Endorsed Standard, the version of the Endorsed Standard supported by the
Product must be Documented.

EE7.3 The Maintenance Lead may authorize the use of newer Versions of
a Technology included in the Technology Under Test. A Product that
provides a newer Version of a Technology must meet the Compatibility
Requirements for that newer Version, and must Document that it supports
the newer Version.

For example, the Jakarta Platform, Enterprise Edition Maintenance Lead
could authorize use of a newer version of a Java technology such as
JAX-WS.

EE8 Except for tests specifically required by this TCK to be rebuilt
(if any), the binary Conformance Tests supplied as part of the Test
Suite or as updated by the Maintenance Lead must be used to certify
compliance.

EE9 The functional programmatic behavior of any binary class or
interface must be that defined by the Specifications.

EE9.1 A Product may contain Operating Modes that meet all of these
requirements, except Rule EE9, provided that:

.  At least the default Product Configuration of each Operating Mode
must meet these requirements, without invoking this rule; testing may
always use such a Product Configuration.
.  The Operating Modes must not violate the Java Platform, Standard
Edition Rules.
.  The Product Configurations of Operating Modes of an application and
its components are configured at deployment time, or by administrative
action, and can not be changed during the runtime of that application.
.  Some Product Configurations of such Operating Modes may provide only
a subset of the functional programmatic behavior required by the
Specifications. The behavior of applications that use more than the
provided subset, when run in such Product Configurations, is
unspecified.
.  The functional programmatic behavior of any binary class or
interface in the above defined subset must be that defined by the
Specifications.
.  Any Product Configuration that invokes this rule must be clearly
Documented as not fully meeting the requirements of the Specifications.

EE10 Each Container must make technically accessible all Java SE
Runtime interfaces and functionality, as defined by the Specifications,
to programs running in the Container, except only as specifically
exempted by these Rules.

EE10.1 Containers may impose security constraints, as defined by the
Specifications.

EE11 A web Container must report an error, as defined by the
Specifications, when processing a Jakarta Server Page that does not conform to the
Specifications.

EE12 The presence of a Java language comment or Java language
directive in a Jakarta Server Page that specifies âjavaâ as the scripting language,
when processed by a web Container, must not cause the functional
programmatic behavior of that Jakarta Server Page to vary from the functional
programmatic behavior of that Jakarta Server Page in the absence of that Java
language comment or Java language directive.

EE13 The contents of any fixed template data (defined by the
Specifications) in a Jakarta Server Page, when processed by a web Container, must
not affect the functional programmatic behavior of that Jakarta Server Page, except
as defined by the Specifications.

EE14 The functional programmatic behavior of a Jakarta Server Page that
specifies âjavaâ as the scripting language must be equivalent to the
functional programmatic behavior of the Jakarta Server Page Implementation Class
constructed from that Jakarta Server Page.

EE15 A Deployment Tool must report an error when processing a
Configuration Descriptor that does not conform to the Specifications.

EE16 The presence of an XML comment in a Configuration Descriptor,
when processed by a Deployment Tool, must not cause the functional
programmatic behavior of the Deployment Tool to vary from the functional
programmatic behavior of the Deployment Tool in the absence of that
comment.

EE17 A Deployment Tool must report an error when processing an Jakarta Enterprise Beans
deployment descriptor that includes an Jakarta Enterprise Beans QL expression that does not
conform to the Specifications.

EE18 The Runtime must report an error when processing a Configuration
Descriptor that does not conform to the Specifications.

EE19 An error must be reported when processing a configuration
descriptor that includes a Java Persistence QL expression that does not
conform to the Specifications.

EE20 The presence of an XML comment in a Configuration Descriptor,
when processed by the Runtime, must not cause the functional
programmatic behavior of the Runtime to vary from the functional
programmatic behavior of the Runtime in the absence of that comment.

EE21 Compliance testing for Jakarta EE 8 consists of running Jakarta EE 8
CTS and the following Technology Compatibility Kits (TCKs):

* Jakarta Contexts and Dependency Injection 2.0
* Jakarta Dependency Injection 1.0 
* Jakarta Bean Validation 2.0

In addition to the compatibility rules outlined in this CTS User's
Guide, Jakarta EE 8 implementations must also adhere to all of the
compatibility rules defined in the User's Guides of the aforementioned
TCKs.

EE22 Source Code in WSDL-to-Java Output when compiled by a Reference
Compiler must execute properly when run on a Reference Runtime.

EE23 Source Code in WSDL-to-Java Output must be in source file format
defined by the Java Language Specification (JLS).

EE24 Java-to-WSDL Output must fully meet W3C requirements for the Web
Services Description Language (WSDL) 1.1.

EE25 A Java-to-WSDL Tool must not produce Java-to-WSDL Output from
source code that does not conform to the Java Language Specification
(JLS).

[[CJACBJIB]][[jakarta-platform-enterprise-edition-version-8-test-appeals-process]]

2.3 Jakarta Platform, Enterprise Edition Version 8 Test Appeals Process
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Jakarta has a well established process for managing challenges to its
TCKs. Any implementor may submit a challenge to one or more tests in the
Jakarta EE version 8 TCK (AKA CTS) as it relates to their implementation.  Implementor
means the entity as a whole in charge of producing the final certified release.
*Challenges filed should represent the consensus of that entity*.

2.3.1 Valid Challenges
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Any test case (e.g., test class, @Test method), test case configuration (e.g., deployment descriptor), test beans, annotations, and other resources considered part of the TCK may be challenged.

The following scenarios are considered in scope for test challenges:

* Claims that a test assertion conflicts with the specification.
* Claims that a test asserts requirements over and above that of the specification.
* Claims that an assertion of the specification is not sufficiently implementable.
* Claims that a test is not portable or depends on a particular implementation.

2.3.2 Invalid Challenges
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
The following scenarios are considered out of scope for test challenges and will be immediately closed if filed:

* Challenging an implementationâs claim of passing a test.  Certification is an honor system and these issues must be raised directly with the implementation.
* Challenging the usefulness of a specification requirement.  The challenge process cannot be used to bypass the specification process and raise in question the need or relevance of a specification requirement.
* Claims the TCK is inadequate or missing assertions required by the specification.  See the Improvement section, which is outside the scope of test challenges.
* Challenges that do not represent a consensus of the implementing community will be closed until such time that the community does agree or agreement cannot be made.  The test challenge process is not the place for implementations to initiate their own internal discussions.
* Challenges to tests that are already excluded for any reason.
* Challenges that an excluded test should not have been excluded and should be re-added should be opened as a new enhancement request

Test challenges must be made in writing via the {TechnologyShortName} specification project issue tracker
as described in link:#CJAJEAEI[Section 2.3.3, "TCK Test Appeals Steps."]

All tests found to be invalid will be placed on the Exclude List
for that version of the {TechnologyShortName} TCK.


[[CJAJEAEI]][[tck-test-appeals-steps]]

2.3.3 TCK Test Appeals Steps
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

1. Challenges should be filed via the Jakarta EE Platform specification projectâs issue tracker using the label `challenge` and include the following information:
* The relevant specification version and section number(s)
* The coordinates of the challenged test(s)
* The exact TCK and exclude list versions
* The implementation being tested, including name and company
* The full test name
* A full description of why the test is invalid and what the correct behavior is believed to be
* Any supporting material; debug logs, test output, test logs, run scripts, etc.

2. Specification project evaluates the challenge. +
Challenges can be resolved by a specification project lead, or a project challenge triage team, after a consensus of the specification project committers is reached or attempts to gain consensus fails.
Specification projects may exercise lazy consensus, voting or any practice that follows the principles of Eclipse Foundation Development Process.
The expected timeframe for a response is two weeks or less.
If consensus cannot be reached by the specification project for a prolonged period of time, the default recommendation is to exclude the tests and address the dispute in a future revision of the specification.

3.  Accepted Challenges. +
A consensus that a test produces invalid results will result in the exclusion of that test from certification requirements, and an immediate update and release of an official distribution of the TCK including the new exclude list. The associated `challenge` issue must be closed with an `accepted` label to indicate it has been resolved.

4.  Rejected Challenges and Remedy. +
When a`challenge` issue is rejected, it must be closed with a label of `invalid` to indicate it has been rejected.
There appeal process for challenges rejected on technical terms is outlined in Escalation Appeal.
If, however, an implementer feels the TCK challenge process was not followed, an appeal issue should be filed with specification projectâs TCK issue tracker using the label `challenge-appeal`.
A project lead should escalate the issue with the Jakarta EE Specification Committee via email (jakarta.ee-spec.committee@eclipse.org).
The committee will evaluate the matter purely in terms of due process.
If the appeal is accepted, the original TCK challenge issue will be reopened and a label of `appealed-challenge` added, along with a discussion of the appeal decision, and the `challenge-appeal` issue with be closed.
If the appeal is rejected, the `challenge-appeal` issue should closed with a label of `invalid`.

5. Escalation Appeal. +
If there is a concern that a TCK process issue has not been resolved satisfactorily, the
https://www.eclipse.org/projects/dev_process/#6_5_Grievance_Handling[Eclipse Development Process Grievance Handling] procedure should be followed to escalate the resolution. Note that this is not a mechanism to attempt to handle implementation specific issues.
