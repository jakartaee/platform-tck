1.1 Compatibility Testing
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Compatibility testing differs from traditional product testing in a
number of ways. The focus of compatibility testing is to test those
features and areas of an implementation that are likely to differ across
other implementations, such as those features that:

* Rely on hardware or operating system-specific behavior
* Are difficult to port
* Mask or abstract hardware or operating system behavior

Compatibility test development for a given feature relies on a complete
specification and compabitle implementation for that feature.
Compatibility testing is not primarily concerned with robustness,
performance, or ease of use.

[[GBFQN]][[why-compatibility-testing-is-important]]

1.1.1 Why Compatibility Testing is Important
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Jakarta Platform compatibility is important to different groups involved
with Jakarta technologies for different reasons:

* Compatibility testing ensures that the Jakarta Platform does not become
fragmented as it is ported to different operating systems and hardware
environments.

* Compatibility testing benefits developers working in the Java
programming language, allowing them to write applications once and then
to deploy them across heterogeneous computing environments without
porting.

* Compatibility testing allows application users to obtain applications
from disparate sources and deploy them with confidence.

* Conformance testing benefits Jakarta Platform implementors by ensuring a
level playing field for all Jakarta Platform ports.

[[GBFPR]][[compatibility-rules]]

1.1.2 Compatibility Rules
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Compatibility criteria for all technology implementations are embodied
in the Compatibility Rules that apply to a specified technology. The
Jakarta EE 9 CTS tests for adherence to these Rules as described in
link:rules.html#GBFSN[Chapter 2, "Procedure for Jakarta Platform, Enterprise
Edition 9 Certification,"] for Jakarta EE 9 and
link:rules-wp.html#GJJPZ[Chapter 3, "Procedure for Jakarta Platform,
Enterprise Edition 9 Web Profile Certification,"] for Jakarta EE 9 Web
Profile.

[[GBFPW]][[cts-overview]]

1.1.3 CTS Overview
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

A Jakarta EE 9 CTS is a set of tools and tests used to verify that a
Implementer's implementation of Jakarta EE 9 technology conforms to the
applicable specification. All tests in the CTS are based on the written
specifications for the Jakarta Platform. The CTS tests compatibility of a
Implementer's implementation of a technology to the applicable
specification of the technology. Compatibility testing is a means of
ensuring correctness, completeness, and consistency across all
implementations developed by technology Implementers.

The set of tests included with the Jakarta EE 9 CTS is called the test
suite. All tests in the CTS test suite are self-checking, but some tests
may require tester interaction. Most tests return either a Pass or Fail
status. For a given platform to be certified, all of the required tests
must pass. The definition of required tests may change from platform to
platform.

The definition of required tests will change over time. Before your
final certification test pass, be sure to download the latest Exclude
List for the Jakarta EE 9 CTS. The definition of required tests will change
over time. See link:#GEUYQ[Section 1.2.5, "Exclude Lists,"] for more
information.

[[GBFPB]][[jakarta-community-community-process-program-and-compatibility-testing]]

1.1.4 Jakarta Specification Community Process Program and Compatibility Testing
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The Jakarta EE Specification Process (JESP) program is the
formalization of the open process that has been used since 2019 to
develop and revise Jakarta EE technology specifications in cooperation
with the international Jakarta EE community. The JESP program specifies
that the following three major components must be included as
deliverables in a final Jakarta EE technology release under the
direction of the responsible specification project committer group:

* Technology Specification
* A Compatible Implementation
* Technology Compatibility Kit (TCK)

For further information about the JESP program, go to Jakarta EE
Specification Process community page (https://jakarta.ee/specifications).

[[GEUZS]][[cts-tests]]

1.2.3 CTS Tests
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The Jakarta EE 9 CTS contains API tests and enterprise edition tests, which
are tests that start in the Jakarta EE 9 platform and use the underlying
enterprise service or services as specified. For example, a JDBC
enterprise edition test connects to a database, uses SQL commands and
the JDBC 4.2 API to populate the database tables with data, queries the
database, and compares the returned results against the expected
results.

[[GEUZU]]

.*Figure 1-1 Typical Jakarta Platform, Enterprise Edition Workflow*
image:img/overviewa.png["Typical Jakarta Platform, Enterprise Edition Workflow"]

Note: References in diagram to Java EE refer to Jakarta EE.

link:#GEUZU[Figure 1-1] shows how most Implementers will use the test
suite. They will set up and run the test suite with the Jakarta Platform,
Enterprise Edition 9 Compatible Implementation (Jakarta EE 9 CI) first to
become familiar with the testing process. Then they will set up and run
the test suite with their own Jakarta EE 9 implementation. This is called the
Vendor Implementation, or VI in this document. When they pass
all of the tests, they will apply for and be granted certification.

* Before you do anything with the test suite, read the rules in
link:rules.html#GBFSN[Chapter 2, "Procedure for Jakarta Platform, Enterprise
Edition 8 Certification,"] or link:rules-wp.html#GJJPZ[Chapter 3,
"Procedure for Jakarta Platform, Enterprise Edition 9 Web Profile
Certification."] These chapters explain the certification process and
provides a definitive list of certification rules for Jakarta EE 9 and Jakarta
EE 9 Web Profile implementations.
* Next, take a look at the test assertions in the Assertion List, which
you can find in the Jakarta EE 9 CTS documentation bundle. The assertions
explain what each test is testing. When you run the tests with the
JavaTest GUI, the assertion being tested as part of the test description
of the currently selected test is displayed.
* Third, install and configure the Jakarta EE 9 CTS software and the Jakarta
EE 9 CI or Jakarta EE 9 Web Profile CI and run the tests as described in
this guide. This will familiarize you with the testing process.
* Finally, set up and run the test suite with your own Jakarta EE 9 or Jakarta
EE 9 Web Profile implementation.


[NOTE]
=======================================================================

In the instructions in this document, variables in angle brackets need
to be expanded for each platform. For example, `<TS_HOME>` becomes
`$TS_HOME` on Solaris/Linux and `%TS_HOME%` on Windows. In addition, the
forward slashes (`/`) used in all of the examples need to be replaced
with backslashes (`\`) for Windows.

=======================================================================


[[GEUYR]][[javatest-harness]]

1.2.4 JavaTest Harness
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The JavaTest harness version 4.4.1 is a set of tools designed to run and
manage test suites on different Java platforms. The JavaTest harness can
be described as both a Java application and a set of compatibility
testing tools. It can run tests on different kinds of Java platforms and
it allows the results to be browsed online within the JavaTest GUI, or
offline in the HTML reports that the JavaTest harness generates.

The JavaTest harness includes the applications and tools that are used
for test execution and test suite management. It supports the following
features:

* Sequencing of tests, allowing them to be loaded and executed
automatically
* Graphic user interface (GUI) for ease of use
* Automated reporting capability to minimize manual errors
* Failure analysis
* Test result auditing and auditable test specification framework
* Distributed testing environment support

To run tests using the JavaTest harness, you specify which tests in the
test suite to run, how to run them, and where to put the results as
described in link:using.html#GBFWO[Chapter 7, "Executing Tests."]

The tests that make up the CTS are precompiled and indexed within the
CTS test directory structure. When a test run is started, the JavaTest
harness scans through the set of tests that are located under the
directories that have been selected. While scanning, the JavaTest
harness selects the appropriate tests according to any matches with the
filters you are using and queues them up for execution.

[[GEUYQ]][[exclude-lists]]

1.2.5 Exclude Lists
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The Jakarta EE 9 CTS includes an Exclude List contained in a `.jtx` file.
This is a list of test file URLs that identify tests which do not have
to be run for the specific version of the CTS being used. Whenever tests
are run, the JavaTest harness automatically excludes any test on the
Exclude List from being executed.

A implementor is not required to pass or run any test on the Exclude List.
The Exclude List file, `<TS_HOME>/bin/ts.jtx`, is included in the Jakarta
EE 9 CTS.


[NOTE]
=======================================================================

Always make sure you are using an up-to-date copy of the Exclude List
before running the Jakarta EE 9 CTS test suite to verify your
implementation.

=======================================================================


A test might be in the Exclude List for reasons such as:

* An error in an underlying implementation API has been discovered which
does not allow the test to execute properly.
* An error in the specification that was used as the basis of the test
has been discovered.
* An error in the test itself has been discovered.
* The test fails due to a bug in the tools (such as the JavaTest
harness, for example).

In addition, all tests are run against the compatible implementations.
Any tests that cannot be run on a compatible Jakarta Platform may be put on the
Exclude List if the Specification project team agrees the test is invalid. 
Any test that is not specification-based, or for which the
specification is vague, may be excluded. Any test that is found to be
implementation dependent (based on a particular thread scheduling model,
based on a particular file system behavior, and so on) may be excluded.


[NOTE]
=======================================================================

Implementers are not permitted to alter or modify Exclude Lists. Changes to
an Exclude List can only be made by using the procedure described in
link:rules.html#CJAICHHD[Section 2.3.1, "Jakarta Platform, Enterprise
Edition Version 8 TCK Test Appeals Steps,"] and
link:rules-wp.html#CEGCHJGH[Section 3.3.1, "Jakarta Platform, Enterprise
Edition Version 8 TCK Test Appeals Steps."]

=======================================================================


[[GEUZN]][[apache-ant]]

1.2.6 Apache Ant
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The Jakarta EE 9 CI, Jakarta EE 9 Web Profile CI, and Jakarta EE 9 CTS require
implementations of Apache Ant 1.9.7 from the Apache Ant Project
(`http://ant.apache.org/`). Apache Ant is a free, open-source,
Java-based build tool, similar in some ways to the make tool, but more
flexible, cross-platform compatible, and centered around XML-based
configuration files.

Ant is invoked in the Jakarta EE 9 CI, Jakarta EE 9 Web Profile CI, and Jakarta
EE 9 CTS in conjunction with various XML files containing Ant targets.
These Ant targets provide a convenient way to automate various
configuration tasks for Jakarta EE 9 CTS. For example, the initial
configuration of the Jakarta EE 9 CI or Jakarta EE 9 Web Profile CI for CTS is
done by means of the `config.vi` Ant target.

The Ant configuration targets are there for your convenience. When
configuring your Jakarta EE 9 or Jakarta EE 9 Web Profile implementation for
the Jakarta EE 9 CTS, you can either set up your environment to use the Ant
tools, or you can perform some or all of your configuration procedures
manually. Jakarta EE 9 CTS includes the Ant Contrib package, and the tasks
included with Ant Contrib are used within the CTS build files. See
`http://ant-contrib.sourceforge.net/` for more information about Ant
Contrib.

This User's Guide does not provide in-depth instruction on Ant internals
or how to configure Ant targets for your particular Jakarta EE 9 or Jakarta EE
8 Web Profile implementation. For complete information about Ant, refer
to the extensive documentation on the Apache Ant Project site. The
Apache Ant Manual is available at
`http://ant.apache.org/manual/index.html`.

Apache Ant is protected under the Apache Software, License 2.0, which is
is available on the Apache Ant Project license page at 
`http://ant.apache.org/license.html`.

===== Installing Apache Ant

* Download the Apache Ant 1.9.7 binary bundle from the Apache Ant 
  Project.
* Change to the directory in which you want to install Apache Ant and
  extract the bundle
* Set the `ANT_HOME` environment variable to point to the 
  `apache-ant-<version>` directory
* Add `<ANT_HOME>/bin` directory to the environment variable `PATH`
