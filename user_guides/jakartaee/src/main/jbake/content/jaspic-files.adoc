C Jakarta Authentication Technology Notes and Files
---------------------------------------------------

The Jakarta Authentication (formerly jaspic) technology tests are used to verify the compatibility of an
implementer's implementation of the Jakarta Authentication 1.1 specification.

This appendix provides information about the following topics:

* link:#GLAFO[Jakarta Authentication 1.1 Technology Overview]
* link:#GLAFE[Jakarta Authentication TSSV Files]

You run the `ant enable.jaspic` command to configure the Jakarta EE 9 CI to
run the Jakarta Authentication tests. After running the Jakarta Authentication tests, you run the
`ant disable.jaspic` command to restore the Jakarta EE 9 CI to the state it
was in before you configured it for running the Jakarta Authentication tests. This is
required because Jakarta Authentication replaces some of the Jakarta EE 9 CI's default
system security components with CTS security components. If this change
is not reverted after the tests have been run, the CI's system security
could be left in a partially working state. The CTS security
`AuthConfigFactory` and `AuthConfigProvider`(s) are designed for
compatibility testing, not the functional completeness that one expects
from the Jakarta EE 9 CI.

C.1 Jakarta Authentication 1.1 Technology Overview
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The Jakarta Authentication 1.1 specification defines a service provider
interface (SPI) by which authentication providers implementing message
authentication mechanisms can be integrated in client and server message
processing runtimes (or containers).

Jakarta EE 9 platform TCK uses a Test Suite SPI Verifier (TSSV) to verify whether
the vendor's message processing runtimes invoke the right SPI in the
right order.

The TSSV includes test suite implementations of:

* `AuthConfigFactory`
* `AuthConfigProvider`
* `AuthConfig(Client & Server)`
* `AuthContext(client & Server)`
* `AuthenticationModules(Client & Server)`

The TSSV gets loaded into vendor's message processing runtime using one of
the following two ways as defined by the Jakarta Authentication 1.1 specification:

* By defining a property in `JAVA_HOME/jre/lib/security/java.security`
as follows:
`authconfigprovider.factory=com.sun.ts.tests.jaspic.tssv.config.TSAuthConfigFactory`

* By calling `registerConfigProvider()` method in vendor's
`AuthConfigFactory` with the following values:

** Test Suite Provider ClassName

** Map of properties

** Message Layer (such as `SOAP` or `HttpServlet`)

** Application Context Identifier

** A description of the provider


[NOTE]
=======================================================================

For the Jakarta EE 9 platform TCK, we register more than one provider in vendor's
message processing runtime.

=======================================================================


In a typical test scenario (for each profile of Servlet or SOAP), an
application is deployed into a vendor's runtime, and a client invokes
the service. The message policies required for the secure invocations
are built into the TSSV implementations, and the runtime is analyzed to see
whether it invokes the right SPIs at the right time.

The TSSV uses Java logging APIs to log the client and server invocation into
a log file (`TSSVLog.txt`), this log file is used by the TCK tests to
validate actual logged runtime information against expected results to
ensure that the runtime is compliant. The `jaspic_util_web.war` file
contains the Jakarta Authentication log file processor, which writes output to the
`TSSVLog.txt` file. The `TSSVLog.txt` file is put into the location
defined by the `log.file.location` property in the `ts.jte` file.

C.2 Jakarta Authentication TSSV Files
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The following sections describe the `tssv.jar`,
`ProviderConfiguration.xml`, and `provider-configuration.dtd` files that
are used by the Jakarta Authentication TCK tests.

[[GLAGR]][[c.2.1-tssv.jar-file]]

C.2.1 tssv.jar file
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The `tssv.jar` file contains classes necessary for populating your
implementation with a CTS AuthConfigFactory (ACF) as well as information
used to register CTS providers. The tssv.jar file contains the class
files for the Test Suite SPI Verifier. The `tssv.jar` file classes need
to be loaded by your implementation's runtime during startup.

[[GLADE]][[c.2.2-providerconfiguration.xml-file]]

C.2.2 ProviderConfiguration.xml file
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The format of the `ProviderConfiguration.xml` file is a test
suite-specific format.  The file was designed to contain test provider
information the test suite uses to populate the ACF with a list of
providers for testing. The file needs to be copied to the location
specified in the ts.jte file by the `provider.configuration.file`
property. An edit to the `ProviderConfiguration.xml` file may be
required for your implementation. The current application context Ids
are generic and should work as is, but there could be some scenarios in
which the application Context Ids may need to be altered.

The value of the `<app-context-id>` element in the
`ProviderConfiguration.xml` file should reflect what your implementation
will use for its internal representation of the application context
identifier for a registered provider. Said differently, the test suite
registers its providers with information from the
`ProviderConfiguration.xml` file but every implementation is not
guaranteed to use the application context identifier that is used in the
call to register the configuration provider. This value of the
`<app-context-id>` element corresponds to the `appContext` argument in
the `AuthConfigFactory.registerConfigProvider()` API. The API
documentation for this method indicates that the `appContext` argument
may be used but is not guaranteed to be used.

The default `ProviderConfiguration.xml` file should work without
modification but you may need to alter the value of the
`<app-context-id>` element as previously described to accommodate the
implementation under test. You need to find the correct application
context identifier for your implementation.

You should enable two levels of logging output to get finer levels of
debugging and tracing information than is turned on by default. This is
done by setting the `traceflag` property in the `ts.jte` file and the
`HARNESS_DEBUG` environment variable to `true`.  If both of these are set,
application context identifier information should appear in the debug
output.

[[GLAFZ]][[c.2.3-provider-configuration.dtd-file]]

C.2.3 provider-configuration.dtd file
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The `provider-configuration.dtd` file is a DTD file that resides in the
same directory as the `ProviderConfiguration.xml` file and describes the
`ProviderConfiguration.xml` file. This file should not be edited.
