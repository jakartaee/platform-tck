4.1 Configuring Your Environment to Run the TCK Against the Compatible Implementation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

After configuring your environment as described in this section,
continue with the instructions in link:#GBFUY[Section 4.6, "Using the
JavaTest Harness Software."]


[NOTE]
=======================================================================

In these instructions, variables in angle brackets need to be expanded
for each platform. For example, `<TS_HOME>` becomes `$TS_HOME` on
UNIX/Linux and `%TS_HOME%` on Windows. In addition, the forward
slashes (`/`) used in all of the examples need to be replaced with
backslashes (`\`) for Windows. Finally, be sure to use the appropriate
separator for your operating system when specifying multiple path
entries (`;` on Windows, `:` on UNIX/Linux).

On Windows, you must escape any backslashes with an extra backslash in
path separators used in any of the following properties, or use forward
slashes as a path separator instead.

=======================================================================

1.  Set the following environment variables in your shell environment:
  a.  `JAVA_HOME` to the directory in which Java SE {SEversion} is installed
  b.  `TS_HOME` to the directory in which the {TechnologyShortName} TCK
  {TechnologyVersion} software is installed
  c.  `PATH` to include the following directories: `JAVA_HOME/bin`,
  +{TechnologyHomeEnv}/bin+, and `ANT_HOME/bin`
2.  If you use Jakarta EE {JakartaEEVersion} Compatible Platform, edit your
 `<TS_HOME>/bin/ts.jte`
file and set the following environment variables:
  a.  Set the `webServerHost` property to the hostname where the web
  server is running that is configured with the {TechnologyShortName} Compatible Implementation. +
  The default setting is `localhost`.
  b.  Set the `webServerPort` property to the port number where the web
  server is running that is configured with the {TechnologyShortName} Compatible Implementation. +
  The default setting is `8000`.
  c.  Set the `jaxws.home` property to the location where the {TechnologyShortName} Compatible Implementation is
  installed. +
  The default setting is `${webcontainer.home}`. The value of this
  property must match the value of the `webcontainer.home` property that
  is set in step link:#BABBJEDF[g].
  d.  Set the `jaxws.classes` property to point to the {TechnologyShortName} Compatible Implementation
  classes/jars. +
  Note that this property is already set and should not require any
  changes.
  e.  Set the
  `impl.vi, impl.vi.deploy.dir, impl.vi.host, and impl.vi.port` properties
  to the supported web container, deploy directory, host and port for the
  {TechnologyShortName} Compatible Implementation. +
  The supported web container for the {TechnologyShortName} Compatible Implementation is the Jakarta EE {JakartaEEVersion} Compatible Platform. So
  the default settings for these properties are as follows:
+
--
[source,oac_no_warn]
----
impl.vi.deploy.dir=${webcontainer.home}/domains/domain1/autodeploy
impl.vi=glassfish
impl.vi.host=${webServerHost}
impl.vi.port=${webServerPort}
----
--
+
  f.  Set the `webcontainer.home` property to the location where the web
  server is installed for the {TechnologyShortName} Compatible Implementation. This will be where the Jakarta EE {JakartaEEVersion}
  Compatible Implementation is installed.
  g.  Set the `porting.ts.url.class.1` property to the porting
  implementation class that is used for obtaining URLs. +
  The default setting for the {TechnologyShortName} Compatible Implementation porting implementation is:
+
--
[source,oac_no_warn]
----
com.sun.ts.lib.implementation.sun.common.SunRIURL
----
--
+
  h.  Set the `user` and `password` properties to the user name and
  password used for the basic authentication tests. +
  The default setting is `j2ee` for both.
  i. Set the `authuser` and `authpassword` properties to the user name
  and password used for the basic authentication tests. +
  The default setting for both is `javajoe`.
  j. Set the `http.server.supports.endpoint.publish` property based on
  whether Endpoint Publish APIs are supported on the container.

3.  If you use the Standalone XML-WS {TechnologyVersion} Compatible Implementation software
with the ApacheTomcat web container, set the following environment variables
in your `<TS_HOME>/bin/ts.jte` file:
  a.  Set `webcontainer.home` value to the location where the Apache Tomcat web
  container is installed (value of `${CATALINA_HOME}`).
  b.  Keep `jaxws.home` default value, which is `${webcontainer.home}`.
  c.  Set `jaxws.lib` value to the location where JAR files/classes were copied:
  `${CATALINA_HOME}/shared/lib`
  d.  Set the `jaxws.classes` to contain all libraries copied to `${jaxws.home}/shared/lib`
  directory. This shell script can generate proper value,
+
--
[source,oac_no_warn]
----
cd ${CATALINA_HOME}/shared/lib && unset first && \
for lib in `ls *.jar`; do
  if [ -n "${first}" ]; then
    echo -n '${pathsep}'
  else
    echo -n 'jaxws.classes=' && first='false'
  fi
  echo -n '${jaxws.lib}/'${lib}
done && echo
----
--
+
which shall contain following list of `jaxws.classes`:
+
*  ${jaxws.lib}/FastInfoset.jar
*  ${jaxws.lib}/gmbal-api-only.jar
*  ${jaxws.lib}/ha-api.jar
*  ${jaxws.lib}/jakarta.activation.jar

*  ${jaxws.lib}/woodstox-core.jar
+
separated by `${pathsep}`
+
`resolver.jar` should be required only on non-Oracle/non-OpenJDK based JDKs.
+
  e.  Set the `impl.vi` and `impl.vi.deploy.dir` properties to the supported
  web container and deploy directory for ApacheTomcat web container:
+
--
[source,oac_no_warn]
----
impl.vi.deploy.dir=${webcontainer.home}/webapps/
impl.vi=tomcat
----
--
+
  f.  Comment out `javaee.home` and all `s1as.` properties.

4.  Edit the catalog file
`<TS_HOME>/src/com/sun/ts/tests/jaxws/common/xml/catalog/META-INF/jax-ws-catalog.xml`,
replacing the host and port settings of `systemId` with the value of
your host and port setting where the WSDL is published.

=======================================================================


[[sthref3]]

Before You Begin

Decide against which {TechnologyShortName} implementation the tests
will be run and determine to which Servlet–compliant Web server the
{TechnologyShortName} TCK applications will be published.

Package the {TechnologyShortName} test applications for that
{TechnologyShortName} implementation and Servlet–compliant Web
server.

See link:rebuild.html#GCLIZ[Appendix B, "Packaging the Test
Applications in Servlet-Compliant WAR Files With VI-Specific
Information,"] for information about repackaging the
{TechnologyShortName} test application.

1.  Set the following environment variables in your shell environment:
  a.  `JAVA_HOME` to the directory in which Java SE {SEversion} is installed
  b.  `TS_HOME` to the directory in which the {TechnologyShortName} TCK
  {TechnologyVersion} software is installed
  c.  `PATH` to include the following directories: `JAVA_HOME/bin`,
  +{TechnologyHomeEnv}/bin+, and `ANT_HOME/bin`
2.  Edit your `<TS_HOME>/bin/ts.jte` file and set the following
environment variables:
  a.  Set the `webServerHost` property to the hostname where the web
  server that is configured with the Vendor Implementation is running. +
  The default setting is `localhost`.
  b.  Set the `webServerPort` property to the port number where the web
  server that is configured with the Vendor Implementation is running. +
  The default setting is `8080`.
  c.  Set the `jaxws.home` property to the location where the Vendor
  Implementation is installed. +
  The default setting is `${webcontainer.home}`. The value of this
  property must match the value of the `webcontainer.home` property that
  is set in step link:#BABDJAHI[g].
  d.  Set the `jaxws.classes` property to point to the Vendor
  Implementation classes/JAR files. +
  As an example, the `ts.jte` file contains the property
  `jaxws.classes.ri`, which contains the classes/jar files that the Jakarta EE {JakartaEEVersion}
  Compatible Platform uses. The `jaxws.classes.ri` settings for the Jakarta EE
  {JakartaEEVersion} Compatible Platform web container are as follows:
+
--
[source,oac_no_warn]
----
jaxws.home.ri=${webcontainer.home.ri}
jaxws.lib.ri=${jaxws.home.ri}/modules
jaxws.classes.ri=${jaxws.lib.ri}/webservices-api-osgi.jar${pathsep}
${jaxws.lib.ri}/jakarta.xml.bind-api.jar${pathsep}
${jaxws.lib.ri}/jaxb-api-osgi.jar${pathsep}
${jaxws.lib.ri}/webservices-osgi.jar${pathsep}
${jaxws.lib.ri}/jaxb-osgi.jar${pathsep}
${jaxws.lib.ri}/gmbal.jar${pathsep}
${jaxws.lib.ri}/management-api.jar${pathsep}
${jaxws.lib.ri}/mimepull.jar${pathsep}
${jaxws.lib.ri}/ha-api.jar${pathsep}
${jaxws.lib.ri}/webservices-api.jar${pathsep}
${jaxws.lib.ri}/jakarta.activation.jar
----
--
+
The `jaxws.classes.ri` settings if using the Apache Tomcat web container
with the Standalone {TechnologyShortName} {TechnologyVersion} Compatible
Implementation should contain all classes copied to `${jaxws.home.ri}/shared/lib`.
  e.  Set the `impl.vi`, `impl.vi.deploy.dir`, `impl.vi.host`, and
  `impl.vi.port` properties to the supported web container, deploy
  directory, host and port for the Vendor Implementation. +
  As an example, the `ts.jte` file contains the settings for the Jakarta EE {JakartaEEVersion}
  Compatible Implementation, which are as follows:
+
--
[source,oac_no_warn]
----
webcontainer.home.ri=/sun/javaee6
impl.ri.deploy.dir=${webcontainer.home.ri}/domains/domain1/autodeploy
impl.ri=glassfish
impl.ri.host=${webServerHost.2}
impl.ri.port=${webServerPort.2}
----
--
+
The Compatible Implementation settings using the Apache Tomcat web container with
the Standalone {TechnologyShortName} {TechnologyVersion} Compatible Implementation
would be as follows:
+
--
[source,oac_no_warn]
----
webcontainer.home.ri=/tomcat
impl.ri=tomcat
impl.ri.deploy.dir=${webcontainer.home.ri}/webapps
impl.ri.host=${webServerHost.2}
impl.ri.port=${webServerPort.2}
----
--
+
  f.  Set the `webcontainer.home` property to the location where the web
  container for the Vendor Implementation is installed.
  g.  Set the `porting.ts.url.class.1` property to the porting
  implementation class that is used for obtaining URLs. +
  The default setting for the {TechnologyShortName} Compatible Implementation porting implementation is:
+
--
[source,oac_no_warn]
----
com.sun.ts.lib.implementation.sun.common.SunRIURL
----
--
+
  h.  Set the `user` and `password` properties to the user name and
  password used for the basic authentication tests. +
  The default setting for both is `j2ee`.
  i. Set the `authuser` and `authpassword` properties to the user name
  and password used for the basic authentication tests. +
  The default setting for both is `javajoe`.
  j. Set the `http.server.supports.endpoint.publish` property based on
  whether Endpoint Publish APIs are supported on the container.
+
3.  Edit the catalog file
`<TS_HOME>/src/com/sun/ts/tests/jaxws/common/xml/catalog /META-INF/jax-ws-catalog.xml`,
replacing the host and port settings of `systemId` with the value of
your host and port setting where the WSDL is published.
4.  Provide your own implementation of the porting package interface
provided with the {TechnologyShortName} TCK. +
The porting package interface, `TSURLInterface.java`, obtains URL
strings for web resources in an implementation-specific manner. API
documentation for the `TSURLInterface.java` porting package interface is
available in the {TechnologyShortName} TCK documentation bundle. +
The `<TS_HOME>/bin/jaxws-url-props.dat` file contains the webservice
endpoint and WSDL URLs that the TCK tests use when running against the
{TechnologyShortName} Compatible Implementation. In the porting package that the TCK uses, the URLs are
returned as is since this is the form that the {TechnologyShortName} Compatible Implementation expects. You
may need an alternate form of these URLs in order to run the TCK tests
in your environment. However, you MUST NOT modify the
`jaxws-url-props.dat` file, but instead make any necessary changes in
your own porting implementation class to transform the URLs
appropriately for your environment.

4.3.2 Configuring Your Environment to Simultaneously Run the {TechnologyShortName} TCK Against the VI and the {TechnologyShortName} Compatible Implementation
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This section describes the steps needed to configure the {TechnologyShortName} TCK so
that all tests can be run; forward tests against the Vendor
Implementation and reverse tests against the {TechnologyShortName} Reference
Implementation.

Since the {TechnologyShortName} TCK needs to be tested against both the {TechnologyShortName}
Reference Implementation and the Vendor Implementation, two separate Web
servers need to be configured. Two individual Web servers are required,
and the same steps, below, must be performed to configure each Web
server.

If you are not going to perform this kind of testing at this time, skip
this section and proceed to link:#GCFOI[Configuring and Starting Your
Application Server or Servers], otherwise perform the steps described in
the following sections:

* link:#GCLHU[Configuring Your Environment to Run the {TechnologyShortName} TCK Against
the Vendor Implementation]
* link:#GCLHF[Configuring Your Environment to Rebuild and Run the {TechnologyShortName}
TCK Against the {TechnologyShortName} Compatible Implementation]

4.3.3 Configuring and Starting Your Application Server or Servers
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Complete the following two procedures to configure your application
server environments for the Compatible Implementation and VI.

[[GCFOC]][[to-configure-the-vendor-implementation-as-your-vi-environment]]

==== 4.3.3.1 To Configure the Vendor Implementation as your VI Environment

  a.  `JAVA_HOME` to the directory in which Java SE is installed
  b.  `TS_HOME` to the directory in which the {TechnologyShortName} TCK {TechnologyVersion} software is
  installed
  c.  `ANT_HOME` should be set in your environment.
2.  Ensure that the `ts.jte` settings for Vendor specific properties
have been configured.

4.3.4 Deploying the {TechnologyShortName} TCK Tests
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The {TechnologyShortName} TCK provides an automatic way of deploying both the prebuilt
and Vendor-built archives to the configured web container or container
by using deployment handlers.

The handler file (`<TS_HOME>/bin/xml/impl/glassfish/deploy.xml`) is
written to be used with the Jakarta EE {JakartaEEVersion} Compatible Platform. If the Vendor chooses not to
use Jakarta EE {JakartaEEVersion} Compatible Platform with their implementation, or chooses to rebuild the
{TechnologyShortName} TCK tests using some other method than the infrastructure
provided, they should create their own version handler file to provide
this functionality.

This section describes the various commands used for deploying the WAR
files to the configured web container.

* link:#GCLJG[Generic Deployment Command Scenarios]
* link:#GCLIW[Deploying the {TechnologyShortName} TCK Prebuilt Archives]
* link:#GCLIL[Deploying the Rebuilt {TechnologyShortName} TCK Tests Against the {TechnologyShortName}
Reference Implementation]

[[GCLJG]][[generic-deployment-command-scenarios]]

==== 4.3.4.1 Generic Deployment Command Scenarios

The `keywords` system property enables you to deploy a subset of the
tests that would normally be deployed in batch mode by means of
`ant deploy`. To specify it, add the option
`-Dkeywords=`value to the `ant` command, where value is either
`forward`, `reverse`, or `all`. The supported values control the
directions in which the rebuildable tests are deployed.

* Setting this property to `all` (the default) deploys both the prebuilt
and Vendor build tests.
* Setting the property to `forward` deploys the prebuilt tests in the
forward direction only.
* Setting the property to `reverse` deploys the Vendor rebuilt tests in
the reverse direction only.

==== 4.3.4.2 Deploying the {TechnologyShortName} TCK Prebuilt Archives

This section explains issues regarding the deployment of the {TechnologyShortName} TCK
prebuilt archives. Before conducting any deployment, ensure that your
environment has been configured by following the instructions in either
the link:#GBFVU[Configuring Your Environment to Run the {TechnologyShortName} TCK
Against the {TechnologyShortName} Reference Implementation] or the
link:#GCLHU[Configuring Your Environment to Run the {TechnologyShortName} TCK Against
the Vendor Implementation] sections.

The `<TS_HOME>/dist` directory contains all the WAR files for the {TechnologyShortName}
TCK web service endpoint tests that have been compiled and generated
using the {TechnologyShortName} Reference Implementation and packaged for deployment on
a Servlet-compliant web container using the standard Web Archive (WAR)
format.

These WAR files contain only portable artifacts for all the TCK web
service endpoint tests, and are tailored to run against the {TechnologyShortName}
Reference Implementation via the `web.xml` file in addition to a runtime
file, `sun-jaxws.xml`. These WAR files allow you to deploy (without any
additional setup or modification) against the {TechnologyShortName} Reference
Implementation to test the various features and functionality of this
implementation.

A Vendor is required to deploy the prebuilt WAR files as is on their
{TechnologyShortName} implementation without any changes to the WAR archives with the
exception of replacing and/or removing only the `web.xml` and the
`sun-jaxws.xml` files.

To deploy the tests, the Vendor should perform a deployment using either
the `deploy` or `deployall` batch command as described in
link:#GCLJG[Generic Deployment Command Scenarios], and specify the
`-Dkeywords=forward` option.

==== 4.3.4.3 Deploying the Rebuilt {TechnologyShortName} TCK Tests Against the {TechnologyShortName} Reference Implementation

This section describes how to deploy the Vendor rebuilt {TechnologyShortName} TCK tests
against the Vendor Implementation. Before conducting the deployment,
ensure that you have followed the instructions in
link:#GBFVU[Configuring Your Environment to Run the {TechnologyShortName} TCK Against
the {TechnologyShortName} Reference Implementation].

This deployment scenario assumes that the Vendor has rebuilt all the
{TechnologyShortName} TCK tests using the existing infrastructure, and that the WAR
files exist alongside the prebuilt war files in the `<TS_HOME>/dist`
directory. The rebuilt WAR files will be prepended with the text
`vi_built_`.

If the Vendor chooses some other method of rebuilding the tests, they
may still be able to use this deployment method as long as the WAR files
are built correctly and are prepended with the text `vi_built_`. Refer
to the link:rebuild.html#GCLIZ[Appendix B, "Rebuilding the {TechnologyShortName} TCK
Using the Vendor's Toolset"] to learn about rebuilding the {TechnologyShortName} TCK
tests.

To deploy the tests, the Vendor should perform a deployment using either
the `deploy` or `deployall` batch command, as described in
link:#GCLJG[Generic Deployment Command Scenarios], and specify the
`-Dkeywords=reverse` option


[[GHGDH]][[custom-configuration-handlers]]

4.4 Custom Configuration Handlers
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Configuration handlers are used to configure and unconfigure a
{TechnologyShortName} {TechnologyVersion} implementation during the
certification process.  These are similar to deployment handlers but
used for configuration.  A configuration handler is an Ant build file
that contains at least the required targets listed below:

  * `config.vi` - to configure the vendor implementation
  * `clean.vi` - to unconfigure the vendor implementation

These targets are called from the `<TS_HOME>/bin/build.xml` file and
call down into the implementation-specific configuration handlers.

To provide your own configuration handler, create a config.vi.xml file
with the necessary configuration steps for your implementation and place
the file under the `<TS_HOME>/bin/xml/impl/<your_impl>` directory.

For more information, you may wish to view `<TS_HOME>/bin/xml/impl/glassfish/config.vi.xml`,
the configuration file for Jakarta EE {JakartaEEVersion} Compatible Implementation, Eclipse GlassFish.

[[GBFWE]][[custom-deployment-handlers]]

4.5 Custom Deployment Handlers
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Deployment handlers are used to deploy and undeploy the WAR files that
contain the tests to be run during the certification process. A deployment
handler is an Ant build file that contains at least the required targets
listed in the table below.

The {TechnologyShortName} TCK provides these deployment handlers:

* `<TS_HOME>/bin/xml/impl/none/deploy.xml`
* `<TS_HOME>/bin/xml/impl/glassfish/deploy.xml`
* `<TS_HOME>/bin/xml/impl/tomcat/deploy.xml`

The `deploy.xml` files in each of these directories are used to control
deployment to a specific container (no deployment, deployment to
the Eclipse GlassFish Web container, deployment to the Tomcat Web container)
denoted by the name of the directory in which each `deploy.xml` file
resides. The primary `build.xml` file in the `<TS_HOME>/bin` directory
has a target to invoke any of the required targets (`-deploy`, `-undeploy`,
`-deploy.all`, `-undeploy.all`).

[[GBFWF]][[create-custom-deployment-handler]]

4.5.1 To Create a Custom Deployment Handler
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To deploy tests to another {TechnologyShortName} implementation, you
must create a custom handler.

1. Create a new directory in the `<TS_HOME>/bin/xml/impl` directory tree.
  For example, create the `<TS_HOME>/bin/xml/impl/my_deployment_handler` directory.
  Replace my_deployment_handler with the value of the impl.vi
  property that you set in Step 5 of the configuration procedure
  described in Section 4.2, "Configuring Your Environment to Repackage
  and Run the TCK Against the Vendor Implementation".

2.  Copy the deploy.xml file from the `<TS_HOME>/bin/xml/impl/none`
  directory to the directory that you created.

3.  Modify the required targets in the `deploy.xml` file.  This is what
    the `deploy.xml` file for the "none" deployment handler looks like.

+
[source,oac_no_warn]
----
<project name="No-op Deployment" default="deploy">
    <!-- No-op deployment target -->
    <target name="-deploy">
        <echo message="No deploy target implemented for this deliverable"/>
    </target>
    <target name="-undeploy">
        <echo message="No undeploy target implemented for this deliverable"/>
    </target>
    <target name="-deploy.all">
        <echo message="No deploy target implemented for this deliverable"/>
    </target>
    <target name="-undeploy.all">
        <echo message="No undeploy target implemented for this deliverable"/>
    </target>
</project>
----
+
Although this example just echoes messages, it does include the four
required Ant targets (`-deploy`, `-undeploy`, `-deploy.all`, `-undeploy.all`)
that your custom `deploy.xml` file must contain. With this as your
starting point, look at the required targets in the `deploy.xml` files
in the Tomcat and Eclipse Glassfish directories for guidance as you create
the same targets for the Web container in which you will run your
implementation of {TechnologyShortName}.

The following Ant targets can be called from anywhere under the
`<TS_HOME>/src` directory:

* `deploy`
* `undeploy`
* `deploy.all`
* `undeploy.all`

The `deploy.all` and `undeploy.all` targets can also be called from the
`<TS_HOME>/bin` directory.

[NOTE]
=======================================================================
The targets in the `deploy.xml` file are never called directly.
They are called indirectly by the targets listed above.

4.6 Using the JavaTest Harness Software
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

There are two general ways to run the {TechnologyShortName} TCK test
suite using the JavaTest harness software:

* Through the JavaTest GUI; if using this method, please continue on to
link:#GBFWG[Section 4.7, "Using the JavaTest Harness Configuration
GUI."]
* In JavaTest batch mode, from the command line in your shell
environment; if using this method, please proceed directly to
link:using.html#GBFWO[Chapter 5, "Executing Tests."]

[[GBFWG]][[using-the-javatest-harness-configuration-gui]]

4.7 Using the JavaTest Harness Configuration GUI
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can use the JavaTest harness GUI to modify general test settings and
to quickly get started with the default {TechnologyShortName} TCK test
environment.  This section covers the following topics:

* link:#GBFVA[Configuration GUI Overview]
* link:#GBFVD[Starting the Configuration GUI]
* link:#GBFVX[To Configure the JavaTest Harness to Run the
{TechnologyShortName} TCK Tests]
* link:#GBFUU[Modifying the Default Test Configuration]


[NOTE]
=======================================================================

It is only necessary to proceed with this section if you want to run the
JavaTest harness in GUI mode. If you plan to run the JavaTest harness in
command-line mode, skip the remainder of this chapter, and continue with
link:using.html#GBFWO[Chapter 5, "Executing Tests."]

=======================================================================


[[GBFVA]][[configuration-gui-overview]]

4.7.1 Configuration GUI Overview
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

In order for the JavaTest harness to execute the test suite, it requires
information about how your computing environment is configured. The
JavaTest harness requires two types of configuration information:

* Test environment: This is data used by the tests. For example, the
path to the Java runtime, how to start the product being tested, network
resources, and other information required by the tests in order to run.
This information does not change frequently and usually stays constant
from test run to test run.
* Test parameters: This is information used by the JavaTest harness to
run the tests. Test parameters are values used by the JavaTest harness
that determine which tests in the test suite are run, how the tests
should be run, and where the test reports are stored. This information
often changes from test run to test run.

The first time you run the JavaTest harness software, you are asked to
specify the test suite and work directory that you want to use. (These
parameters can be changed later from within the JavaTest harness GUI.)

Once the JavaTest harness GUI is displayed, whenever you choose Start,
then Run Tests to begin a test run, the JavaTest harness determines
whether all of the required configuration information has been supplied:

* If the test environment and parameters have been completely
configured, the test run starts immediately.
* If any required configuration information is missing, the
configuration editor displays a series of questions asking you the
necessary information. This is called the configuration interview. When
you have entered the configuration data, you are asked if you wish to
proceed with running the test.

[[GBFVD]][[starting-the-configuration-gui]]

4.7.2 Starting the Configuration GUI
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Before you start the JavaTest harness software, you must have a valid
test suite and Java SE {SEversion} installed on your system.

The {TechnologyShortName} TCK includes an Ant script that is used to execute the
JavaTest harness from the `<TS_HOME>` directory. Using this Ant script
to start the JavaTest harness is part of the procedure described in
link:#GBFVX[Section 4.7.3, "To Configure the JavaTest Harness to Run the
TCK Tests."]

When you execute the JavaTest harness software for the first time, the
JavaTest harness displays a Welcome dialog box that guides you through
the initial startup configuration.

* If it is able to open a test suite, the JavaTest harness displays a
Welcome to JavaTest dialog box that guides you through the process of
either opening an existing work directory or creating a new work
directory as described in the JavaTest online help.
* If the JavaTest harness is unable to open a test suite, it displays a
Welcome to JavaTest dialog box that guides you through the process of
opening both a test suite and a work directory as described in the
JavaTest documentation.

After you specify a work directory, you can use the Test Manager to
configure and run tests as described in link:#GBFVX[Section 4.7.3, "To
Configure the JavaTest Harness to Run the TCK Tests."]

[[GBFVX]][[to-configure-the-javatest-harness-to-run-the-tck-tests]]

4.7.3 To Configure the JavaTest Harness to Run the TCK Tests
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The answers you give to some of the configuration interview questions
are specific to your site. For example, the name of the host on which
the JavaTest harness is running. Other configuration parameters can be
set however you wish. For example, where you want test report files to
be stored.

Note that you only need to complete all these steps the first time you
start the JavaTest test harness. After you complete these steps, you can
either run all of the tests by completing the steps in
link:using.html#GBFUZ[Section 5.1, "Starting JavaTest,"] or run a subset
of the tests by completing the steps in link:using.html#GBFWM[Section
5.2, "Running a Subset of the Tests."]

1.  Change to the `<TS_HOME>/bin` directory and start the JavaTest test
harness: +
`cd <TS_HOME>/bin` +
`ant gui`
2.  From the File menu, click *Open Quick Start Wizard*. +
The Welcome screen displays.
3.  Select *Start a new test run*, and then click *Next*. +
You are prompted to create a new configuration or use a configuration
template.
4.  Select *Create a new configuration*, and then click *Next*. +
You are prompted to select a test suite.
5.  Accept the default suite (`<TS_HOME>/src`), and then click *Next*. +
You are prompted to specify a work directory to use to store your test
results.
6.  Type a work directory name or use the *Browse* button to select a work
directory, and then click *Next*. +
You are prompted to start the configuration editor or start a test run.
At this point, the {TechnologyShortName} TCK is configured to run the
default test suite.
7.  Deselect the *Start the configuration editor* option, and then click
*Finish*.
8.  Click *Run Tests*, then click *Start*. +
The JavaTest harness starts running the tests.
9.  To reconfigure the JavaTest test harness, do one of the following:
* Click *Configuration*, then click *New Configuration*.
* Click *Configuration*, then click *Change Configuration*.
10. Click *Report*, and then click *Create Report*.
11. Specify the directory in which the JavaTest test harness will write
the report, and then click *OK*. +
A report is created, and you are asked whether you want to view it.
12. Click *Yes* to view the report.

[[GBFUU]][[modifying-the-default-test-configuration]]

4.7.4 Modifying the Default Test Configuration
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The JavaTest GUI enables you to configure numerous test options. These
options are divided into two general dialog box groups:

* Group 1: Available from the JavaTest *Configure/Change Configuration*
submenus, the following options are displayed in a tabbed dialog box:

** *Tests to Run*

** *Exclude List*

** *Keywords*

** *Prior Status*

** *Test Environment*

** *Concurrency*

** *Timeout Factor*
* Group 2: Available from the JavaTest *Configure/Change
Configuration/Other Values* submenu, or by pressing `Ctrl+E`, the following
options are displayed in a paged dialog box:

** *Environment Files*

** *Test Environment*

** *Specify Tests to Run*

** *Specify an Exclude List*

Note that there is some overlap between the functions in these two
dialog boxes; for those functions use the dialog box that is most
convenient for you. Please refer to the JavaTest Harness documentation
or the online help for complete information about these various options.
