NOTE TO WRITERS:
Most technologies will only need the compatibility rules in rules.adoc.
Some technologies will need additional rules.  If they're needed,
remove the comment block delimiters below and update the rules as
appropriate.  You may need to adjust the rule numbers to avoid gaps.

The first comment block below is additional rules needed by
Jakarta Persistence.

The second comment block below is additional rules needed by
Jakarta Server Pages and Jakarta Servlet.
(And Jakarta Enterprise Beans, if it had a standalone TCK.)

The third comment block below is additional rules that apply
to any technology that defines deployment descriptors.

The fourth comment block is special rules that apply only to
Jakarta Server Pages.

NOTE: This set of examples is NOT complete, but should be.

*{techID}10* The Runtime must report an error when processing a
Configuration Descriptor that does not conform to the Specifications.

*{techID}11* An error must be reported when processing a configuration
descriptor that includes a Jakarta Persistence QL expression that does not
conform to the Specifications.

*{techID}12* The presence of an XML comment in a Configuration
Descriptor, when processed by the Runtime, must not cause the
functional programmatic behavior of the Runtime to vary from the
functional programmatic behavior of the Runtime in the absence of that
comment.

///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
*{techID}10* Each Container must make technically accessible all Java SE
Runtime interfaces and functionality, as defined by the Specifications,
to programs running in the Container, except only as specifically
exempted by these Rules.

*{techID}10.1* Containers may impose security constraints, as defined by
the Specifications.

*{techID}11* A Deployment Tool must report an error when processing a
Configuration Descriptor that does not conform to the Specifications.

*{techID}12* The presence of an XML comment in a Configuration
Descriptor, when processed by a Deployment Tool, must not cause the
functional programmatic behavior of the Deployment Tool to vary from
the functional programmatic behavior of the Deployment Tool in the
absence of that comment.

*{techID}11* A web Container must report an error, as defined by the
Specifications, when processing a Jakarta Server Pages Page that does
not conform to the Specifications.

*{techID}12* The presence of a Java language comment or Java language
directive in a Jakarta Server Pages Page that specifies ”java” as the
scripting language, when processed by a web Container, must not cause
the functional programmatic behavior of that Jakarta Server Pages Page
to vary from the functional programmatic behavior of that Jakarta
Server Pages Page in the absence of that Java language comment or Java
language directive.

*{techID}13* The contents of any fixed template data (defined by the
Specifications) in a Jakarta Server Pages Page, when processed by a web
Container, must not affect the functional programmatic behavior of that
Jakarta Server Pages Page, except as defined by the Specifications.

*{techID}14* The functional programmatic behavior of a Jakarta Server
Pages Page that specifies ”java” as the scripting language must be
equivalent to the functional programmatic behavior of the Jakarta
Server Pages Page Implementation Class constructed from that Jakarta
Server Pages Page.
