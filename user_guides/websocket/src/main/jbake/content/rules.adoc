[[CJAFGIGG]][[compatibility-requirements]]

2.2 Compatibility Requirements
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The compatibility requirements for {TechnologyShortName}
{TechnologyVersion} consist of meeting the requirements set forth by
the rules and associated definitions contained in this section.

[[sthref4]][[definitions]]

2.2.1 Definitions
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

These definitions are for use only with these compatibility requirements
and are not intended for any other purpose.

[[sthref5]][[sthref6]]

Table 2-1 DefinitionsÂ 

[width="100%",cols="25%,75%",options="header",]
|=======================================================================
|Term |Definition
|API Definition Product |A Product for which the only Java class files
contained in the product are those corresponding to the application
programming interfaces defined by the Specifications, and which is
intended only as a means for formally specifying the application
programming interfaces defined by the Specifications.

|Computational Resource a|
A piece of hardware or software that may vary in quantity, existence, or
version, which may be required to exist in a minimum quantity and/or at
a specific or minimum revision level so as to satisfy the requirements
of the Test Suite.

Examples of computational resources that may vary in quantity are RAM
and file descriptors.

Examples of computational resources that may vary in existence (that is,
may or may not exist) are graphics cards and device drivers.

Examples of computational resources that may vary in version are
operating systems and device drivers.

|Configuration Descriptor |Any file whose format is well defined by a
specification and which contains configuration information for a set of
Java classes, archive, or other feature defined in the specification.

|Conformance Tests |All tests in the Test Suite for an indicated
Technology Under Test, as distributed by the Maintenance Lead, excluding
those tests on the Exclude List for the Technology Under Test.

|Documented |Made technically accessible and made known to users,
typically by means such as marketing materials, product documentation,
usage messages, or developer support programs.

|Exclude List |The most current list of tests, distributed by the
Maintenance Lead, that are not required to be passed to certify
conformance. The Maintenance Lead may add to the Exclude List for that
Test Suite as needed at any time, in which case the updated Exclude List
supplants any previous Exclude Lists for that Test Suite.

|Libraries a|
The class libraries, as specified through the Java Community Process
(JCP), for the Technology Under Test.

The Libraries for {TechnologyFullName} are listed at the end of this chapter.

|Location Resource a|
A location of classes or native libraries that are components of the
test tools or tests, such that these classes or libraries may be
required to exist in a certain location in order to satisfy the
requirements of the test suite.

For example, classes may be required to exist in directories named in a
CLASSPATH variable, or native libraries may be required to exist in
directories named in a PATH variable.

|Maintenance Lead |The Java Community Process member responsible for
maintaining the Specification, reference implementation, and TCK for the
Technology. Oracle is the Maintenance Lead for {TechnologyFullName}.

|Operating Mode a|
Any Documented option of a Product that can be changed by a user in
order to modify the behavior of the Product.

For example, an Operating Mode can be binary (enable/disable
optimization), an enumeration (select from a list of protocols), or a
range (set the maximum number of active threads).

Note that an Operating Mode may be selected by a command line switch, an
environment variable, a GUI user interface element, a configuration or
control file, etc.

|Product |A licensee product in which the Technology Under Test is
implemented or incorporated, and that is subject to compatibility
testing.

|Product Configuration a|
A specific setting or instantiation of an Operating Mode.

For example, a Product supporting an Operating Mode that permits user
selection of an external encryption package may have a Product
Configuration that links the Product to that encryption package.

|Rebuildable Tests |Tests that must be built using an
implementation-specific mechanism. This mechanism must produce
specification-defined artifacts. Rebuilding and running these tests
against the Java EE 8 RI verifies that the mechanism generates
compatible artifacts.

|Resource |A Computational Resource, a Location Resource, or a Security
Resource.

|Rules |These definitions and rules in this Compatibility Requirements
section of this User's Guide.

|Security Resource a|
A security privilege or policy necessary for the proper execution of the
Test Suite.

For example, the user executing the Test Suite will need the privilege
to access the files and network resources necessary for use of the
Product.

|Specifications a|
The documents produced through the Java Community Process that define a
particular Version of a Technology.

The Specifications for the Technology Under Test are referenced later in
this chapter.

|Technology |Specifications and a reference implementation produced
through the Java Community Process.

|Technology Under Test |Specifications and the reference implementation
for {TechnologyFullName} Version {TechnologyVersion}.

|Test Suite |The requirements, tests, and testing tools distributed by
the Maintenance Lead as applicable to a given Version of the Technology.

|Version |A release of the Technology, as produced through the Java
Community Process.

[[sthref7]][[rules-for-products]]

2.2.2 Rules for {TechnologyFullName} Products
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The following rules apply for each version of an operating system,
software component, and hardware platform Documented as supporting the
Product:

*{techID}1* The Product must be able to satisfy all applicable compatibility
requirements, including passing all Conformance Tests, in every Product
Configuration and in every combination of Product Configurations, except
only as specifically exempted by these Rules.

For example, if a Product provides distinct Operating Modes to optimize
performance, then that Product must satisfy all applicable compatibility
requirements for a Product in each Product Configuration, and
combination of Product Configurations, of those Operating Modes.

*{techID}1.1* If an Operating Mode controls a Resource necessary for the
basic execution of the Test Suite, testing may always use a Product
Configuration of that Operating Mode providing that Resource, even if
other Product Configurations do not provide that Resource.
Notwithstanding such exceptions, each Product must have at least one set
of Product Configurations of such Operating Modes that is able to pass
all the Conformance Tests.

For example, a Product with an Operating Mode that controls a security
policy (i.e., Security Resource) which has one or more Product
Configurations that cause Conformance Tests to fail may be tested using
a Product Configuration that allows all Conformance Tests to pass.

*{techID}1.2* A Product Configuration of an Operating Mode that causes the
Product to report only version, usage, or diagnostic information is
exempted from these compatibility rules.

*{techID}1.3* An API Definition Product is exempt from all functional
testing requirements defined here, except the signature tests.

*{techID}2* Some Conformance Tests may have properties that may be changed.
Properties that can be changed are identified in the configuration
interview. Properties that can be changed are identified in the JavaTest
Environment (.jte) files in the Test Suite
installation. Apart from changing such properties and other allowed
modifications described in this User's Guide (if any), no source or
binary code for a Conformance Test may be altered in any way without
prior written permission. Any such allowed alterations to the
Conformance Tests would be posted to the Java Licensee Engineering web
site and apply to all licensees.

*{techID}3* The testing tools supplied as part of the Test Suite or as
updated by the Maintenance Lead must be used to certify compliance.

*{techID}4* The Exclude List associated with the Test Suite cannot be
modified.

*{techID}5* The Maintenance Lead can define exceptions to these Rules. Such
exceptions would be made available to and apply to all licensees.

*{techID}6* All hardware and software component additions, deletions, and
modifications to a Documented supporting hardware/software platform,
that are not part of the Product but required for the Product to satisfy
the compatibility requirements, must be Documented and available to
users of the Product.

For example, if a patch to a particular version of a supporting
operating system is required for the Product to pass the Conformance
Tests, that patch must be Documented and available to users of the
Product.

*{techID}7* The Product must contain the full set of public and protected
classes and interfaces for all the Libraries. Those classes and
interfaces must contain exactly the set of public and protected methods,
constructors, and fields defined by the Specifications for those
Libraries. No subsetting, supersetting, or modifications of the public
and protected API of the Libraries are allowed except only as
specifically exempted by these Rules.

*{techID}7.1* If a Product includes Technologies in addition to the
Technology Under Test, then it must contain the full set of combined
public and protected classes and interfaces. The API of the Product
must contain the union of the included Technologies. No further
modifications to the APIs of the included Technologies are allowed.

ifdef::subset-allowed[]
*{techID}7.2* The Product may contain a subset of the classes and
interfaces for the Libraries.
endif::subset-allowed[]

*{techID}8* Except for tests specifically required by this TCK to be rebuilt
(if any), the binary Conformance Tests supplied as part of the Test
Suite or as updated by the Maintenance Lead must be used to certify
compliance.

*{techID}9* The functional programmatic behavior of any binary class or
interface must be that defined by the Specifications.

2.3 Test Appeals Process
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Oracle has a well established process for managing challenges to its
Java technology Test Suites and plans to continue using a similar
process in the future. Oracle, as {TechnologyShortName} Maintenance Lead, will
authorize representatives from the Java Partner Engineering group to be
the point of contact for all test challenges. Typically this will be the
engineer assigned to a company as part of its {TechnologyShortName} TCK support.

If a test is determined to be invalid in function or if its basis in the
specification is suspect, the test may be challenged by any licensee of
the {TechnologyShortName} TCK. Each test validity issue must be covered
by a separate test challenge. Test validity or invalidity will be
determined based on its technical correctness such as:

* Test has bugs (i.e., program logic errors).
* Specification item covered by the test is ambiguous.
* Test does not match the specification.
* Test assumes unreasonable hardware and/or software requirements.
* Test is biased to a particular implementation.

Challenges based upon issues unrelated to technical correctness as
defined by the specification will normally be rejected.

Test challenges must be made in writing to Java Partner Engineering and
include all relevant information as described in link:#CJAFGAEE[Example
2-1, "Test Challenge Form"]. The process used to determine the validity
or invalidity of a test (or related group of tests) is described in
link:#CJAJEAEI[Section 2.3.1, "TCK Test Appeals Steps."]

All tests found to be invalid will either be placed on the Exclude List
for that version of the {TechnologyShortName} TCK or have an alternate
test made available.

* Tests that are placed on the Exclude List will be placed on the
Exclude List within one business day after the determination of test
validity. The new Exclude List will be made available to all
{TechnologyShortName} TCK licensees on the Java Licensee Engineering website.
* Oracle, as Maintenance Lead has the option of creating alternative
tests to address any challenge. Alternative tests (and criteria for
their use) will be made available on the Java Licensee Engineering
website. +

[NOTE]
=======================================================================

Passing an alternative test is deemed equivalent to passing the original
test.

=======================================================================


[[CJAJEAEI]][[tck-test-appeals-steps]]

2.3.1 TCK Test Appeals Steps
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

1.  {TechnologyFullName} TCK licensee writes a test
challenge to Java Licensee Engineering contesting the validity of one or
a related set of {TechnologyShortName} tests. +
A detailed justification for why each test should be invalidated must be
included with the challenge as described in link:#CJAFGAEE[Example 2-1,
"Test Challenge Form"].
2.  Java Licensee Engineering evaluates the challenge. +
If the appeal is incomplete or unclear, it is returned to the submitting
licensee for correction. If all is in order, Java Licensee Engineering
will check with the responsible test developers to review the purpose
and validity of the test before writing a response as described in
link:#CJAGGCIF[Example 2-2, "Test Challenge Response Form"]. Java
Licensee Engineering will attempt to complete the response within 5
business days. If the challenge is similar to a previously rejected test
challenge (i.e., same test and justification), Java Licensee Engineering
will send the previous response to the licensee.
3.  The challenge and any supporting materials from test developers is
sent to the specification engineers for evaluation. +
A decision of test validity or invalidity is normally made within 15
working days of receipt of the challenge. All decisions will be
documented with an explanation of why test validity was maintained or
rejected.
4.  The licensee is informed of the decision and proceeds accordingly. +
If the test challenge is approved and one or more tests are invalidated,
Oracle places the tests on the Exclude List for that version of the
{TechnologyFullName} TCK (effectively removing the test(s) from
the Test Suite). All tests placed on the Exclude List will have a bug
report written to document the decision and made available to all
licensees through the bug reporting database. If the test is valid but
difficult to pass due to hardware or operating system limitations,
Oracle may choose to provide an alternate test to use in place of the
original test (all alternate tests are made available to the licensee
community).
5.  If the test challenge is rejected, the licensee may choose to
escalate the decision to the Executive Committee (EC), however, it is
expected that the licensee would continue to work with Oracle to resolve
the issue and only involve the EC as a last resort.
