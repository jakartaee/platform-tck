10 Building and Debugging Tests
-------------------------------

For final certification and branding, all tests must be run through the
JavaTest test harness. However, you can execute different Ant targets
during your build and debug cycle. The following sections describe how
to use Ant with the following targets to rebuild, list, and run tests:

* `runclient`
* `clean`
* `build`
* `ld`, `lld`, `lc`, `llc`, `pd`, `pc`

Licensees can only run the version of the tests provided with the CTS
for certification, except in the case of rebuildable tests.

This chapter includes the following topics:

* link:#GFATJ[Configuring Your Build Environment]
* link:#GFAPW[Building the Tests]
* link:#GFARS[Running the Tests]
* link:#GFATN[Listing the Contents of dist/classes Directories]
* link:#GFATK[Debugging Service Tests]

[[GFATJ]][[configuring-your-build-environment]]

10.1 Configuring Your Build Environment
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Complete the following steps to set up your environment to build,
deploy, and run the CTS tests using Ant. The following example is for
the Solaris platform:

1.  Set the following environment variables in your shell environment to
use the build infrastructure that comes with the TCK:
* `TS_HOME` to the directory in which the Java EE 8 CTS software is
installed.
* `TS_HOME/bin` to your `PATH` in your command shell.
* C Shell: +
[source,oac_no_warn]
----
setenv PATH ${TS_HOME}/bin:${PATH}
----
Bourne Shell: +
[source,oac_no_warn]
----
PATH=${TS_HOME}/bin:${PATH}
export PATH
----
* `JAVA_HOME` to the directory in which the Java SE 8 software is
installed.
* `JAVAEE_HOME` to the directory in which the Java Platform, Enterprise
Edition RI is installed.
2.  Unset `ANT_HOME`, if it is currently set in your environment.
3.  Change to the `<TS_HOME>/bin` directory and verify that the `ts.jte`
file has the following properties set:
* `webserver.home`: the directory in which the Java Web Server is
installed
* `webserver.host`: the host on which the Web server is running
* `webserver.port`: the port on which the Web server is running
* `javaee.home.ri`: the directory in which the Java Platform, Enterprise
Edition RI is installed for reference to the packager tool used by the
build infrastructure
* `ts.classpath`: required classes needed for building/running the TCK

10.2 Building the Tests
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To build the Java EE 8 CTS tests using Ant, complete the following
steps:

1.  To build a single test directory, type the following: +
[source,oac_no_warn]
----
cd <TS_HOME>/src/com/sun/ts/tests/test_dir 
ant clean build
----
This cleans and builds the tests in the directory specified for
test_dir.
2.  To list the classes directory for this test that was built, type the
following: +
[source,oac_no_warn]
----
ant lc
----
or +
[source,oac_no_warn]
----
ant llc
----
3.  To list the distribution directory of archives for this test that
was built, type the following: +
[source,oac_no_warn]
----
ant pd
----
or +
[source,oac_no_warn]
----
ant pc
----

10.3 Running the Tests
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To run the Java EE 8 CTS tests using Ant, use one of the following
procedures.

[[GFAOW]][[to-run-a-single-test-directory]]

10.3.1 To Run a Single Test Directory
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To run a single test directory, type the following:

[source,oac_no_warn]
----
cd <TS_HOME>/src/com/sun/ts/tests/test_dir
ant runclient
----

This runs all tests in test_dir.

[[GFARF]][[to-run-a-single-test-within-a-test-directory]]

10.3.2 To Run a Single Test Within a Test Directory
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To run a single test within a test directory, type the following:

[source,oac_no_warn]
----
cd <TS_HOME>/src/com/sun/ts/tests/test_dir
ant runclient -Dtest=test_name
----

This runs only the test_name in the test_dir test directory. To show all
the tests that can be run from a particular test directory, change to
the directory and execute the `list.tests` Ant task. The actual test
name displays to the right of the pound sign (#), which follows the
fully qualified name of the client class.

[[GFATN]][[listing-the-contents-of-distclasses-directories]]

10.4 Listing the Contents of dist/classes Directories
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can use various Ant targets to list the contents of corresponding
`dist/classes` directories from the `src` directory without leaving the
`src` directory. All listings are sorted by modification time, with the
most recent modification listed first. Output is redirected to `more`.
The format may vary on Windows and Unix. Ant does not support changing
directory into the `dist/classes` directories, but you can copy and
paste the first line of the output, which is the target path.

The Ant list targets are as follows:

* `ld`: Lists the contents of the current test's dist directory
* `lld`: Provides a long listing of the contents of the current test's
dist directory
* `lc`: Lists the contents of the current test's classes directory
* `llc`: Provides a long listing of the contents of the current test's
classes directory
* `pd`: Starts a new shell placed into the current test's dist directory
* `pc`: Starts a new shell placed into the current test's classes
directory

If you run these targets in a directory that is not under the `src`
directory, they will list the contents of the current directory.


[NOTE]
=======================================================================

`pc`, `lc`, and `llc` also support the `-Dbuild.vi` property for listing
the rebuildable tests. The rebuildable tests are located under
`<TS_HOME>/classes_vi_built` instead of `<TS_HOME>/classes`.

=======================================================================


The following listing shows sample output for the Ant `lc` target.

[source,oac_no_warn]
----
cd $TS_HOME/src/com/sun/ts/tests/samples/ejb/ee/simpleHello
ant lc
<TS_HOME>/classes/com/sun/ts/tests/samples/ejb/ee/simpleHello
----------------------------------------------------------------
Hello.class
HelloClient.class
HelloEJB.class
HelloHome.class

ant -Dbuild.vi=true lc
<TS_HOME>/classes_vi_built/com/sun/ts/tests/samples/ejb/ee/simpleHello
----------------------------------------------------------------
Hello.class
HelloClient.class
HelloEJB.class
HelloHome.class

[[GFATK]][[debugging-service-tests]]

10.5 Debugging Service Tests
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The Java EE 8 CTS service tests test the compatibility of the Java
Platform, Enterprise Edition Service APIs: JavaMail, JDBC, JMS, JTA,
JAX-WS, JWS, CAJ, and RMI over IIOP. The test suite contains sets of
tests that the JavaTest harness, in conjunction with the Java EE 8 CTS
harness extensions, runs from different Java Platform, Enterprise
Edition containers (enterprise bean, JSP, Servlet, and application
client). The test suite wraps each of these tests inside generic
components, called vehicles. Each Java EE 8 CTS service test has been
set up to run in a default set of vehicles. Each technology's
specification determines this set. When run as part of the certification
process, all service API tests must pass in their default vehicle set.

Refer to the `<TS_HOME>/src/vehicle.properties` file to for a list the
default vehicle sets for the Java EE 8 CTS service API tests.

To help you debug service API tests, the test suite provides a mechanism
that allows for fine-grained control over which tests you can run in
specific vehicles. When you override the default vehicle set for a
particular set of service tests, the new set of vehicles must be a
subset of the valid vehicle set for that set of tests. If the new set is
not a subset of the default set, the test suite will use the default
set. link:#GFATI[Example 10-1] illustrates this mechanism.


[NOTE]
=======================================================================

You can only use this mechanism for debugging purposes. For
certification, you must run using the default set of vehicles.

=======================================================================


[[GFASE]][[examples]]

10.5.1 Examples
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

[[GFATI]]

Example 10-1 Running RMI/IIOP Enterprise Edition Tests

To run the RMI/IIOP enterprise edition tests in the application client
vehicle only, set the following system property in the
`<TS_HOME>/bin/build.xml` file for the Ant `gui` or `runclient` targets:

[source,oac_no_warn]
----
<sysproperty key="tests_rmiiiop_ee.service_eetest.vehicles" 
  value="appclient"/>
----

This property overrides the default vehicle set for all tests under the
specified directory (and in every subdirectory of that directory). Note
that the first part of the property name matches the tests directory
structure as it appears under `<TS_HOME>` (with the underscore character
(`_`) replacing any file separator, such as the slash character (`/`) or
the backslash character (`\`).

Before you run the test or tests, you should temporarily rename the file
`<TS_HOME>/src/testsuite.jtd`.

[[GFATY]]

Example 10-2 Restricting the JDBC Test Run

To restrict the JDBC test run to the servlet and JSP vehicles only, set
the following system property in the `<TS_HOME>/bin/build.xml` file for
the Ant `gui` or `runclient` targets:

[source,oac_no_warn]
----
<sysproperty key="tests_jdbc_ee.service_eetest.vehicles" 
  value="servlet jsp"/>
----

Before you run the test or tests, you should temporarily rename the file
`<TS_HOME>/src/testsuite.jtd`.

Note that you must remove these properties before you run the Java EE 8
CTS test suite for certification.

[[GFARW]][[obtaining-additional-debugging-information]]

10.5.2 Obtaining Additional Debugging Information
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

When running the JavaTest harness in command-line mode, you can obtain
additional debugging information by setting the `HARNESS_DEBUG`
environment variable, as follows:

[source,oac_no_warn]
----
setenv HARNESS_DEBUG=true
----

Subsequent runs with the Ant `runclient` command generate additional
debugging information.

You can also generate additional test run information by seting the
`<TS_HOME>/bin/ts.jte` `harness.log.traceflag` property as follows:

[source,oac_no_warn]
----
harness.log.traceflag=true
----
