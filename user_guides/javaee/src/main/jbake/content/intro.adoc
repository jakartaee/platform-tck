1.1 Compatibility Testing
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Compatibility testing differs from traditional product testing in a
number of ways. The focus of compatibility testing is to test those
features and areas of an implementation that are likely to differ across
other implementations, such as those features that:

* Rely on hardware or operating system-specific behavior
* Are difficult to port
* Mask or abstract hardware or operating system behavior

Compatibility test development for a given feature relies on a complete
specification and reference implementation for that feature.
Compatibility testing is not primarily concerned with robustness,
performance, or ease of use.

[[GBFQN]][[why-compatibility-testing-is-important]]

1.1.1 Why Compatibility Testing is Important
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Java platform compatibility is important to different groups involved
with Java technologies for different reasons:

* Compatibility testing ensures that the Java platform does not become
fragmented as it is ported to different operating systems and hardware
environments.
* Compatibility testing benefits developers working in the Java
programming language, allowing them to write applications once and then
to deploy them across heterogeneous computing environments without
porting.
* Compatibility testing allows application users to obtain applications
from disparate sources and deploy them with confidence.
* Conformance testing benefits Java platform implementors by ensuring a
level playing field for all Java platform ports.

[[GBFPR]][[compatibility-rules]]

1.1.2 Compatibility Rules
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Compatibility criteria for all technology implementations are embodied
in the Compatibility Rules that apply to a specified technology. The
Java EE 8 CTS tests for adherence to these Rules as described in
link:rules.html#GBFSN[Chapter 2, "Procedure for Java Platform, Enterprise
Edition 8 Certification,"] for Java EE 8 and
link:rules-wp.html#GJJPZ[Chapter 3, "Procedure for Java Platform,
Enterprise Edition 8 Web Profile Certification,"] for Java EE 8 Web
Profile.

[[GBFPW]][[cts-overview]]

1.1.3 CTS Overview
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

A Java EE 8 CTS is a set of tools and tests used to verify that a
licensee's implementation of Java EE 8 technology conforms to the
applicable specification. All tests in the CTS are based on the written
specifications for the Java platform. The CTS tests compatibility of a
licensee's implementation of a technology to the applicable
specification of the technology. Compatibility testing is a means of
ensuring correctness, completeness, and consistency across all
implementations developed by technology licensees.

The set of tests included with the Java EE 8 CTS is called the test
suite. All tests in the CTS test suite are self-checking, but some tests
may require tester interaction. Most tests return either a Pass or Fail
status. For a given platform to be certified, all of the required tests
must pass. The definition of required tests may change from platform to
platform.

The definition of required tests will change over time. Before your
final certification test pass, be sure to download the latest Exclude
List for the Java EE 8 CTS. The definition of required tests will change
over time. See link:#GEUYQ[Section 1.2.5, "Exclude Lists,"] for more
information.

[[GBFPB]][[java-community-process-jcp-program-and-compatibility-testing]]

1.1.4 Java Community Process (JCP) Program and Compatibility Testing
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The Java Community Process (JCP) program is the formalization of the
open process that has been used since 1995 to develop and revise Java
technology specifications in cooperation with the international Java
community. The JCP program specifies that the following three major
components must be included as deliverables in a final Java technology
release under the direction of the responsible Expert Group:

* Technology Specification
* Reference Implementation
* Technology Compatibility Kit (TCK)

For further information about the JCP program, go to Java Community
Process (`http://jcp.org/en/home/index`).

[[GEUZS]][[cts-tests]]

1.2.3 CTS Tests
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The Java EE 8 CTS contains API tests and enterprise edition tests, which
are tests that start in the Java EE 8 platform and use the underlying
enterprise service or services as specified. For example, a JDBC
enterprise edition test connects to a database, uses SQL commands and
the JDBC 4.2 API to populate the database tables with data, queries the
database, and compares the returned results against the expected
results.

[[GEUZU]]

.*Figure 1-1 Typical Java Platform, Enterprise Edition Workflow*
image:img/overviewa.png["Typical Java Platform, Enterprise Edition Workflow"]


link:#GEUZU[Figure 1-1] shows how most licensees will use the test
suite. They will set up and run the test suite with the Java Platform,
Enterprise Edition 8 Reference Implementation (Java EE 8 RI) first to
become familiar with the testing process. Then they will set up and run
the test suite with their own Java EE 8 implementation. When they pass
all of the tests, they will apply for and be granted certification.

* Before you do anything with the test suite, read the rules in
link:rules.html#GBFSN[Chapter 2, "Procedure for Java Platform, Enterprise
Edition 8 Certification,"] or link:rules-wp.html#GJJPZ[Chapter 3,
"Procedure for Java Platform, Enterprise Edition 8 Web Profile
Certification."] These chapters explain the certification process and
provides a definitive list of certification rules for Java EE 8 and Java
EE 8 Web Profile implementations.
* Next, take a look at the test assertions in the Assertion List, which
you can find in the Java EE 8 CTS documentation bundle. The assertions
explain what each test is testing. When you run the tests with the
JavaTest GUI, the assertion being tested as part of the test description
of the currently selected test is displayed.
* Third, install and configure the Java EE 8 CTS software and the Java
EE 8 RI or Java EE 8 Web Profile RI and run the tests as described in
this guide. This will familiarize you with the testing process.
* Finally, set up and run the test suite with your own Java EE 8 or Java
EE 8 Web Profile implementation.


[NOTE]
=======================================================================

In the instructions in this document, variables in angle brackets need
to be expanded for each platform. For example, `<TS_HOME>` becomes
`$TS_HOME` on Solaris/Linux and `%TS_HOME%` on Windows. In addition, the
forward slashes (`/`) used in all of the examples need to be replaced
with backslashes (`\`) for Windows.

=======================================================================


[[GEUYR]][[javatest-harness]]

1.2.4 JavaTest Harness
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The JavaTest harness version 4.4.1 is a set of tools designed to run and
manage test suites on different Java platforms. The JavaTest harness can
be described as both a Java application and a set of compatibility
testing tools. It can run tests on different kinds of Java platforms and
it allows the results to be browsed online within the JavaTest GUI, or
offline in the HTML reports that the JavaTest harness generates.

The JavaTest harness includes the applications and tools that are used
for test execution and test suite management. It supports the following
features:

* Sequencing of tests, allowing them to be loaded and executed
automatically
* Graphic user interface (GUI) for ease of use
* Automated reporting capability to minimize manual errors
* Failure analysis
* Test result auditing and auditable test specification framework
* Distributed testing environment support

To run tests using the JavaTest harness, you specify which tests in the
test suite to run, how to run them, and where to put the results as
described in link:using.html#GBFWO[Chapter 7, "Executing Tests."]

The tests that make up the CTS are precompiled and indexed within the
CTS test directory structure. When a test run is started, the JavaTest
harness scans through the set of tests that are located under the
directories that have been selected. While scanning, the JavaTest
harness selects the appropriate tests according to any matches with the
filters you are using and queues them up for execution.

[[GEUYQ]][[exclude-lists]]

1.2.5 Exclude Lists
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The Java EE 8 CTS includes an Exclude List contained in a `.jtx` file.
This is a list of test file URLs that identify tests which do not have
to be run for the specific version of the CTS being used. Whenever tests
are run, the JavaTest harness automatically excludes any test on the
Exclude List from being executed.

A licensee is not required to pass or run any test on the Exclude List.
The Exclude List file, `<TS_HOME>/bin/ts.jtx`, is included in the Java
EE 8 CTS.


[NOTE]
=======================================================================

Always make sure you are using an up-to-date copy of the Exclude List
before running the Java EE 8 CTS test suite to verify your
implementation.

=======================================================================


A test might be in the Exclude List for reasons such as:

* An error in an underlying implementation API has been discovered which
does not allow the test to execute properly.
* An error in the specification that was used as the basis of the test
has been discovered.
* An error in the test itself has been discovered.
* The test fails due to a bug in the tools (such as the JavaTest
harness, for example).

In addition, all tests are run against the reference implementations.
Any tests that fail when run on a reference Java platform are put on the
Exclude List. Any test that is not specification-based, or for which the
specification is vague, may be excluded. Any test that is found to be
implementation dependent (based on a particular thread scheduling model,
based on a particular file system behavior, and so on) may be excluded.


[NOTE]
=======================================================================

Licensees are not permitted to alter or modify Exclude Lists. Changes to
an Exclude List can only be made by using the procedure described in
link:rules.html#CJAICHHD[Section 2.3.1, "Java Platform, Enterprise
Edition Version 8 TCK Test Appeals Steps,"] and
link:rules-wp.html#CEGCHJGH[Section 3.3.1, "Java Platform, Enterprise
Edition Version 8 TCK Test Appeals Steps."]

=======================================================================


[[GEUZN]][[apache-ant]]

1.2.6 Apache Ant
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The Java EE 8 RI, Java EE 8 Web Profile RI, and Java EE 8 CTS require
implementations of Apache Ant 1.9.7 from the Apache Ant Project
(`http://ant.apache.org/`). Apache Ant is a free, open-source,
Java-based build tool, similar in some ways to the make tool, but more
flexible, cross-platform compatible, and centered around XML-based
configuration files.

Ant is invoked in the Java EE 8 RI, Java EE 8 Web Profile RI, and Java
EE 8 CTS in conjunction with various XML files containing Ant targets.
These Ant targets provide a convenient way to automate various
configuration tasks for Java EE 8 CTS. For example, the initial
configuration of the Java EE 8 RI or Java EE 8 Web Profile RI for CTS is
done by means of the `config.vi` Ant target.

The Ant configuration targets are there for your convenience. When
configuring your Java EE 8 or Java EE 8 Web Profile implementation for
the Java EE 8 CTS, you can either set up your environment to use the Ant
tools, or you can perform some or all of your configuration procedures
manually. Java EE 8 CTS includes the Ant Contrib package, and the tasks
included with Ant Contrib are used within the CTS build files. See
`http://ant-contrib.sourceforge.net/` for more information about Ant
Contrib.

This User's Guide does not provide in-depth instruction on Ant internals
or how to configure Ant targets for your particular Java EE 8 or Java EE
8 Web Profile implementation. For complete information about Ant, refer
to the extensive documentation on the Apache Ant Project site. The
Apache Ant Manual is available at
`http://ant.apache.org/manual/index.html`.

Apache Ant is protected under the Apache Software, License 2.0, which is
is available on the Apache Ant Project license page at 
`http://ant.apache.org/license.html`.

*Installing Apache Ant*
* Download the Apache Ant 1.9.7 binary bundle from the Apache Ant 
  Project.
* Change to the directory in which you want to install Apache Ant and
  extract the bundle
* Set the `ANT_HOME` environment variable to point to the 
  `apache-ant-<version>` directory
* Add `<ANT_HOME>/bin` directory to the environment variable `PATH`
