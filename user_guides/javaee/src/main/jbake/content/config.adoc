5 Setup and Configuration
-------------------------

This chapter describes how to set up the Java EE 8 CTS test suite and
configure it to work with your test environment. It is recommended that
you first set up the testing environment using the Java EE 8 RI and then
with your Java EE 8 server.

This chapter includes the following topics:

* link:#GEWTL[Allowed Modifications]
* link:#GEWTP[Configuring the Test Environment]
* link:#GEWTQ[Configuring a Java EE 8 Server]
* link:#GEXPP[Modifying Environment Settings for Specific Technology
Tests]
* link:#GEYPB[Using the JavaTest Harness Configuration GUI]

[[GEWTL]][[allowed-modifications]]

5.1 Allowed Modifications
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can modify the following test suite components only:

* Your implementation of the porting package
* `ts.jte` environment file
* The vendor-specific SQL files in `<TS_HOME>/sql`
* Any files in `<TS_HOME>/bin` and `<TS_HOME>/bin/xml` (except for
`ts.*` files)

[[GEWTP]][[configuring-the-test-environment]]

5.2 Configuring the Test Environment
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The instructions in this section and in link:#GEWWA[Section 5.3.3,
"Configuring Your Application Server as the VI,"] step you through the
configuration process for the Solaris, Microsoft Windows, and Linux
platforms.

All CTS test configuration procedures are based on running the Ant
scripts against a set of build targets. The primary location of any
configuration settings you are likely to make is the
`<TS_HOME>/bin/ts.jte` environment file. You may also want to modify the
`javaee_vi.xml` and `initdb.xml` Ant configuration files and the
vendor-specific SQL files. These two files contain predefined Ant
targets that are implemented such that they automatically configure the
Java EE 8 RI and its associated database in order to pass the CTS. A
licensee may choose to implement these targets to work with their server
environment to perform the steps described in link:#GEWWA[Section 5.3.3,
"Configuring Your Application Server as the VI."]


[NOTE]
=======================================================================

Ant targets are available at all levels of the CTS source tree that
allow you to execute a wide variety of test scenarios and
configurations.

=======================================================================


[[sthref15]]

Before You Begin

In these instructions, variables in angle brackets need to be expanded
for each platform. For example, `<TS_HOME>` becomes `$TS_HOME` on
Solaris/Linux and `%TS_HOME%` on Windows. In addition, the forward
slashes (`/`) used in all of the examples need to be replaced with
backslashes (`\`) for Windows.

1.  Identify the software pieces and assemble them into the Java EE 8
platform to be tested for certification.
2.  Implement the porting package APIs. +
Some functionality in the Java EE 8 platform is not completely specified
by an API. To handle this situation, the Java EE 8 CTS test suite
defines a set of interfaces in the `com.sun.cts.porting` package, which
serve to abstract any implementation-specific code. You must create your
own implementations of the porting package interfaces to work with your
particular Java EE 8 server environment. See
link:portingpackage.html#GFAUG[Section 11.2, "Porting Package APIs,"] for
additional information about the porting APIs. API documentation for the
porting package interfaces is available in the `<TS_HOME>/docs/api`
directory.
3.  Set up the Java Platform, Enterprise Edition Reference
Implementation (RI) server. +
See link:#GEWUI[Section 5.3.2, "Configuring the Java EE 8 RI as the
VI,"] for a list of the modifications that must be made to run CTS
against the Java EE 8 RI.
4.  Set up the vendor's Java EE 8 server implementation (VI). +
See link:#GEWWA[Section 5.3.3, "Configuring Your Application Server as
the VI,"] for a list of the modifications that must be made to run CTS
against the vendor's Java EE 8 server.
5.  Validate your configuration. +
Run the sample tests provided. If the tests pass, your basic
configuration is valid. See link:using.html#GFACS[Section 7.3,
"Validating Your Test Configuration,"] for information about using
JavaTest to run the sample tests.
6.  Run the CTS tests. +
See link:using.html#GBFWO[Chapter 7, "Executing Tests,"] for information
about Starting JavaTest and running tests.

[[GEWTQ]][[configuring-a-java-ee-8-server]]

5.3 Configuring a Java EE 8 Server
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This section describes how to configure the Java EE 8 server under test.
You can run the CTS tests against the Java EE 8 RI or your own Java
Platform, Enterprise Edition server. When performing interoperability
(interop) tests or web service-based tests, you will be running two Java
EE 8 servers, one of which must be the Java EE 8 RI using the bundled
Java DB database.

For the purposes of this section, it is useful to clarify three terms as
they are used here:

* Reference Implementation (RI): Java EE 8 RI
* Vendor Implemention (VI): Java EE 8 implementation from a vendor other
than Oracle; typically, the goal of running the CTS is to certify a Java
EE 8 VI; in some cases, for purposes of familiarizing yourself with CTS,
you may choose to run the Java EE 8 RI as the VI
* Bundled Derby: Derby database bundled with the Java EE 8 RI

[[GEWSQ]][[java-platform-enterprise-edition-server-configuration-scenarios]]

5.3.1 Java Platform, Enterprise Edition Server Configuration Scenarios
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

There are three general scenarios for configuring Java EE 8 servers for
Java EE 8 CTS testing:

* Configure the Java EE 8 RI as the server under test +
image:img/serverpath-ri.png["RI as Server Under Test"]

Use the Java EE 8 RI as the Java EE 8 VI; you may want to do this as a
sanity check to make sure you are comfortable with using the Java EE 8
CTS against a known standard RI with certified sample applications
before proceeding with tests against your Java EE 8 VI. See
link:#GEWUI[Section 5.3.2, "Configuring the Java EE 8 RI as the VI,"]
for instructions.
* Configure your Java EE 8 VI as Server Under Test +
image:img/serverpath-vi.png["VI as Server Under Test"]

This is the primary goal of using the Java EE 8 CTS; you will eventually
need to configure the Java EE 8 implementation you want to certify. See
link:#GEWWA[Section 5.3.3, "Configuring Your Application Server as the
VI,"] for instructions.
* Configure two Java EE 8 servers for the purpose of interop testing +
image:img/serverpath-interop.png["Two Servers for Interop Testing"]

Rebuildable tests and Interop tests require that you configure two Java
EE 8 servers on one or two machines. One server will be your Java EE 8
VI running a database of your choice with JDBC 4.1-compliant drivers.
The second server must be the Java EE 8 RI using the bundled Java DB
database. See link:#GEXMH[Section 5.3.4, "Configuring a Java Platform,
Enterprise Edition RI and VI for Interop/Rebuildable Tests,"] for
instructions.

In terms of the Java EE 8 CTS, all CTS configuration settings are made
in the `<TS_HOME>/bin/ts.jte` file. When configuring a Java EE 8 server,
the important thing is to make sure that the settings you use for your
server match those in the `ts.jte` file.

These configuration scenarios are described in the following sections.

[[GEWUI]][[configuring-the-java-ee-8-ri-as-the-vi]]

5.3.2 Configuring the Java EE 8 RI as the VI
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To configure the Java EE 8 RI as the server under test (that is, to use
the Java EE 8 RI as the VI) follow the steps listed below. In this
scenario, the goal is simply to test the Java EE 8 RI against the CTS
for the purposes of familiarizing yourself with CTS test procedures. You
may also want to refer to the Quick Start guides included with the Java
EE 8 CTS for similar instructions.

1.  Set server properties in your `<TS_HOME>/bin/ts.jte` file to suit
your test environment. +
Be sure to set the following properties:
1.  Set the `webServerHost` property to the name of the host on which
your Web server is running that is configured with the RI. +
The default setting is `localhost`.
2.  Set the `webServerPort` property to the port number of the host on
which the Web server is running and configured with the RI. +
The default setting is `8001`.
3.  Set the `wsgen.ant.classname` property to the Vendor's
implementation class that mimics the RI Ant task that in turn calls the
`wsgen` Java-to-WSDL tool. +
The default setting is `com.sun.tools.ws.ant.WsGen`.
4.  Set the `wsimport.ant.classname` property to the Vendor's
implementation class that mimics the RI Ant task that in turn calls the
`wsimport` WSDL-to-Java tool. +
The default setting is `com.sun.tools.ws.ant.WsImport`.
5.  Set the `porting.ts.url.class` property to your porting
implementation class that is used for obtaining URLs. +
The default setting for the RI porting implementation is
`com.sun.ts.lib.implementation.sun.common.SunRIURL`.
6.  Set the database-related properties in the `<TS_HOME>/bin/ts.jte`
file. +
link:database-config.html#GFKMW[Section D.3, "Database Properties in
ts.jte,"] lists the names and descriptions for the database properties
you need to set.
7.  Add the following JVM option to the `command.testExecuteAppClient`
property to enable the Security Manager in the application client
container: +
[source,oac_no_warn]
----
-Djava.security.manager
----
Add this option to the list of other -D JVM options for this property. +
As mentioned previously, these settings can vary, but must match
whatever you used when setting up the Java EE 8 RI server.
2.  Install the Java EE 8 RI and configure basic settings, as described
in link:install.html#GBFTP[Chapter 4, "Installation."]
3.  Start the Java EE 8 RI application server. +
Refer to the application server documentation for complete instructions.
4.  Enable the Security Manager. +
If you are using the Java EE 8 RI, execute the following command from
the command line: +
[source,oac_no_warn]
----
asadmin create-jvm-options -Djava.security.manager
----
5.  Stop and restart your application server so it is running with the
Security Manager enabled.
6.  Change to the `<TS_HOME>/bin` directory.
7.  Start your backend database. +
If you are using Derby as your backend database, execute the
`start.javadb` Ant target: +
[source,oac_no_warn]
----
ant -f xml/impl/glassfish/s1as.xml start.javadb
----
Otherwise, refer to your backend database administration documentation
for information about starting your database server.
8.  Initialize your backend database. +
If you are using Derby as your backend database, execute the
`init.derby` Ant target: +
[source,oac_no_warn]
----
ant -f xml/init.xml init.derby
----
If you are not using Derby as your backend database, refer to
link:database-config.html#GFAVUb[Appendix D, "Configuring Your Backend
Database."] +

[NOTE]
=======================================================================

If you are using MySQL or MS SQL Server as your backend database, see
link:#GJLGQ[Section 5.4.25, "Backend Database Setup,"] for additional
database setup instructions.

=======================================================================

9.  Run the configuration Ant target. +
[source,oac_no_warn]
----
ant config.vi
----
::

[NOTE]
=======================================================================

By default, the `config.vi` Ant task configures the entire application
server. Sometimes you may not want or need to configure everything, such
as connector RAR files. If you are not performing connector-related
tests, you can avoid the deployment and configuration of RAR files by
using the Ant option `-Dskip.config.connector=true`. This will reduce
configuration times, the deployment of unneeded RAR files, and the
creation of unnecessary resources on the server under test. For example,
the following command will do this.

[source,oac_no_warn]
----
ant -Dskip.config.connector=true config.vi
----

=======================================================================

10. Build the special web services clients. +
The special webservices tests under the `webservices12/specialcases`
directory have prebuilt endpoints, but the clients are not prebuilt. The
clients will be built after the endpoints are first predeployed to the
application server under test. +
During the build, the clients import the WSDLs (by means of the Java EE
`wsimport` and `wsgen` tools) from the predeployed webservices
endpoints. This process verifies that importing a WSDL from a
predeployed webservice endpoint works properly. +
To build the special webservices clients, the following command must be
executed: +
[source,oac_no_warn]
----
ant build.special.webservices.clients 
----
This predeploys all the special webservices endpoints, builds all the
special webservices clients, and then undeploys the special webservices
endpoints. See link:portingpackage.html#GKLJO[Section 11.2.2, "Ant-Based
Deployment Interface,"] for more information about the Ant-based
deployment interface, including guidelines for creating your own
Ant-based deployment implementation.
11. Continue on to link:using.html#GBFWO[Chapter 7, "Executing Tests,"]
for instructions on running tests.

[[GEWWA]][[configuring-your-application-server-as-the-vi]]

5.3.3 Configuring Your Application Server as the VI
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To use a Java EE 8 server other than the Java EE 8 RI, follow the steps
below.

1.  Set server properties in your `<TS_HOME>/bin/ts.jte` file to suit
your test environment. +
Be sure to set the following properties:
1.  Set the `webServerHost` property to the name of the host on which
your Web server is running that is configured with the RI. +
The default setting is `localhost`.
2.  Set the `webServerPort` property to the port number of the host on
which the Web server is running and configured with the RI. +
The default setting is `8001`.
3.  Set the `wsgen.ant.classname` property to the Vendor's
implementation class that mimics the RI Ant task that in turn calls the
`wsgen` Java-to-WSDL tool. +
The default setting is `com.sun.tools.ws.ant.WsGen`.
4.  Set the `wsimport.ant.classname` property to the Vendor's
implementation class that mimics the RI Ant task that in turn calls the
`wsimport` WSDL-to-Java tool. +
The default setting is `com.sun.tools.ws.ant.WsImport`.
5.  Set the `porting.ts.url.class` property to your porting
implementation class that is used for obtaining URLs.
6.  Set the database-related properties in the `<TS_HOME>/bin/ts.jte`
file. +
link:database-config.html#GFKMW[Section D.3, "Database Properties in
ts.jte,"] lists the names and descriptions for the database properties
you need to set.
7.  Add the following JVM option to the `command.testExecuteAppClient`
property to enable the Security Manager in the application client
container: +
[source,oac_no_warn]
----
-Djava.security.manager
----
Add this option to the list of other -D JVM options for this property. +
These settings can vary, but must match whatever you used when setting
up your Java Platform, Enterprise Edition server.
2.  Install the Java Platform, Enterprise Edition VI and configure basic
settings. +
If you want to configure your Java Platform, Enterprise Edition server
using Ant configuration target similar to the target for the Java EE 8
RI, as described in link:install.html#GBFTP[Chapter 4, "Installation,"]
you will need to modify the `<TS_HOME>/bin/xml/javaee_vi.xml` file to
implement the defined Ant targets for your application server. Then run: +
[source,oac_no_warn]
----
ant config.vi
----
The Ant configuration targets you implement, if any, may vary. Whichever
configuration method you choose, make sure that all configuration steps
in this procedure are completed as shown.
3.  Enable the Security Manager and then stop and restart your
application server so it is running with the Security Manager enabled.
4.  Provide alternate endpoint and WSDL URLs, if necessary. +
The `<TS_HOME>/bin` directory contains the following `.dat` files:
* `jaxrpc-url-props.dat`
* `jaxws-url-props.dat`
* `jws-url-props.dat`
* `webservices12-url-props.dat` +
These files contain the webservice endpoint and WSDL URLs that the CTS
tests use when running against the RI. In the porting package used by
the CTS, the URLs are returned as is since this is the form that the RI
expects. You may need an alternate form of these URLs to run the CTS
tests in your environment. However, you MUST NOT modify the existing
`.dat` files, but instead make any necessary changes in your own porting
implementation class to transform the URLs appropriately for your
environment.
5.  Install and configure a database for the server under test.
6.  Start your database.
7.  Initialize your database for CTS tests.
1.  If you choose to not implement the `javaee_vi.xml` targets, execute
the following command to specify the appropriate DML file: +
(Java DB Example) +
[source,oac_no_warn]
----
ant -Dtarget.dml.file=tssql.stmt \
-Ddml.file=javadb/javadb.dml.sql copy.dml.file
----
2.  Execute the following command to initialize your particular
database: +
[source,oac_no_warn]
----
ant -f <TS_HOME>/bin/xml/initdb.xml init.Database
----
For example, to initialize a Java DB database: +
[source,oac_no_warn]
----
ant -f <TS_HOME>/bin/xml/initdb.xml init.javadb
----
Refer to link:database-config.html#GFAVUb[Appendix D, "Configuring Your
Backend Database,"] for detailed database configuration and
initialization instructions and a list of database-specific
initialization targets.
8.  Start your Java EE 8 server.
9.  [[BABDADHA]] +
Set up required users and passwords.
1.  Set up database users and passwords that are used for JDBC
connections. +
The Java EE 8 CTS requires several user names, passwords, and
user-to-role mappings. These need to match those set in your `ts.jte`
file. By default, `user1`, `user2`, `user3, password1`, `password2`, and
`password3` are set to `cts1`.
2.  [[BABBHFAI]] +
Set up users and passwords for your Java Platform, Enterprise Edition
server. +
For the purpose of running the CTS test suite, these should be set as
follows: +
[width="100%",cols="33%,33%,34%",options="header",]
|=========================================
|User |Password |Groups
|`j2ee_vi` |`j2ee_vi` |`staff`
|`javajoe` |`javajoe` |`guest`
|`j2ee` |`j2ee` |`staff`, `mgr`, `asadmin`
|`j2ee_ri` |`j2ee_ri` |`staff`
|=========================================

Note that adding the `asadmin` group is only necessary when running
against the Java EE 8 RI application server. It is required in this case
because the management EJB (MEjb) in the Java EE 8 server is protected
with the `asadmin` group. Other appservers may or may not choose to
protect their MEjb. If necessary for your appserver implementation, you
should also add the group name with which your MEjb is protected. +
Also make sure the principal to role-mappings that are specified in the
runtime XML files (see link:csiv2logs.html#GEXUI[Section B.6.1, "The
security-role-mapping Element"]) are properly mapped in your
environment. Note that the principal-to-role mappings may vary for each
application.
10. Make sure that the appropriate JDBC 4.1-compliant database driver
class, any associated database driver native libraries, and the correct
database driver URL are available.
11. Configure your Java Platform, Enterprise Edition server to use the
appropriate JDBC logical name (`jdbc/DB1`) when accessing your database
server.
12. Configure your Java EE 8 server to use the appropriate logical name
(`jdbc/DBTimer`) when accessing your EJB timer.
13. Provide access to a JNDI lookup service.
14. Provide access to a Web server.
15. Provide access to a JavaMail server that supports the SMTP protocol.
16. Execute the `add.interop.certs` Ant target. +

[NOTE]
=======================================================================

This step installs server side certificates for interoperability
testing; that is, it installs the RI's server certificate to VI and VI's
server certificate into the RI. This step is necessary for mutual
authentication tests in which both the server and client authenticate to
each other.

=======================================================================

17. [[BABEGCJH]] +
Install the client-side certificate in the `trustStore` on the Java EE 8
server. See link:#GEXWW[CSIv2 Test Setup] for more information. +
Certificates are located `<TS_HOME>/bin/certificates`. Use the
certificate that suits your environment.
1.  `cts_cert`: For importing the CTS client certificate into a
`truststore`
2.  `clientcert.jks`: Used by the Java SE 8 runtime to identify the CTS
client's identity
3.  `clientcert.p12`: Contains CTS client certificate in `pkcs12` format
18. Append the file `<TS_HOME>/bin/server_policy.append` to the Java
policy file or files on your Java EE 8 server. +
This file contains the grant statements used by the test harness,
signature tests, and API tests.
19. Append the file `<TS_HOME>/bin/client_policy.append` to the
application client's Java policy file, which is referenced in the
`TestExecuteAppClient` section of the `ts.jte` file.
20. Make the appropriate transaction interoperability setting on the
Java EE 8 server and the server that is running the Java EE 8 RI. +
See link:#GEXWW[Section 5.4.19, "CSIv2 Test Setup."]
21. If necessary, refer to the sections later in this chapter for
additional configuration information you may require for your particular
test goals. +
For example, see link:#GEXWW[Section 5.4.19, "CSIv2 Test Setup,"] for
configuration settings required for CSIv2 tests.
22. Restart your Java EE 8 server.
23. Build the special Web services clients. +
This step may be bypassed at this time if you are not going to
immediately run the tests under
`<TS_HOME>/src/com/sun/ts/tests/webservices12`. However, you must return
to this configuration section and complete it inorder to run these
tests. +
The special Web services tests under the `webservices12/specialcases`
directory have prebuilt endpoints, but the clients are not prebuilt. The
clients will be built after the endpoints are first predeployed to the
application server under test. +
During the build the clients import the WSDLs (by means of the Java EE
`wsimport` and `wsgen` tools) from the predeployed Web services
endpoints. This process verifies that importing a WSDL from a
predeployed Web service endpoint works properly.
1.  Install the Java EE 8 RI.
2.  Set the following properties in your `<TS_HOME>/bin/ts.jte` file. +
The current values should be saved since they will be needed later in
this step.
* Set the `javaee.home.ri` property to the location where the Java EE 8
RI is installed.
* Set the `wsgen.ant.classname` property to the Java EE 8 application
server Ant task that in turn calls the `wsimport` Java-to-WSDL tool. It
must be set to: +
[source,oac_no_warn]
----
com.sun.tools.ws.ant.WsGen
----
* Set the `wsgen.classpath` property to: +
[source,oac_no_warn]
----
${javaee.classes.ri}:${tools.jar}
----
* Set the `wsimport.ant.classname` property to the Java EE 8 application
server Ant task that in turn calls the `wsimport` WSDL-to-Java tool. +
It must be set to `com.sun.tools.ws.ant.WsImport`
* Set the `wsimport.classpath` property to the following value: +
[source,oac_no_warn]
----
${javaee.classes.ri}:${tools.jar}
----
3.  Build the special Web services clients by executing the following
command: +
[source,oac_no_warn]
----
ant build.special.webservices.clients 
----
This predeploys all the special Web services endpoints, builds all the
special webservices clients, and then undeploys the special webservices
endpoints. See link:portingpackage.html#GKLJO[Section 11.2.2, "Ant-Based
Deployment Interface,"] for more information about the Ant-based
deployment interface, including guidelines for creating your own
Ant-based deployment implementation.
4.  Once this command completes successfully, the following `ts.jte`
properties must be set back to their previous values:
* `wsgen.ant.classname`
* `wsgen.classpath`
* `wsimport.ant.classname`
* `wsimport.classpath`
5.  The following `webservices12-url-props.dat` properties must be set
back to their original values:
* `specialcases.defaultserviceref.wsdlloc`
* `specialcases.nameattrserviceref.wsdlloc`
* `specialcases.providerserviceref.wsdlloc`
24. Continue on to link:using.html#GBFWO[Chapter 7, "Executing Tests"].

5.3.4 Configuring a Java Platform, Enterprise Edition RI and VI for
Interop/Rebuildable Tests
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Use the following procedure to configure the Java EE 8 CTS for
interoperability and rebuildable testing. Note that you must complete
all of the setup instructions in this section and all of the steps in
link:#GEXWW[Section 5.4.19, "CSIv2 Test Setup,"] before you run the
CSIv2 tests.

1.  Install and configure basic settings for the Java EE 8 VI and the
Java EE 8 RI. +
These procedures are described earlier in this section. You can run the
Java EE 8 servers on separate machines or on the same machine. If
running both servers on the same machine, be careful to avoid
conflicting properties (for example, port settings).
2.  Make sure that the following properties have been set in the
`ts.jte` file:
* `create.cmp.tables=true`
* `javaee.home=`Java EE 8 VI installation directory (JAVAEE_HOME)
* `javaee.home.ri=`Java EE 8 RI installation directory
* `mailuser1=`valid email address
* `mailHost=`valid SMTP server
* `orb.host=`host where the Java EE 8 VI naming server is running
* `orb.port=`port where the Java EE 8 VI naming service is running
* `orb.host.ri=`host where the Java EE 8 RI naming service is running
* `orb.port.ri=`port where the Java EE 8 RI naming service is running
* `webServerHost=`host where the Java EE 8 VI Web server is running
* `webServerPort=`port where the Java EE 8 VI Web server is running
* `webServerHost.2=`host where the Java EE 8 RI Web server is running
* `webServerPort.2=`port where the Java EE 8 RI Web server is running
* `securedWebServicePort=`port where the Java EE 8 secure web service is
running
* `securedWebServicePort.2=`port where the Java EE 8 RI secure web
service is running
* `porting.ts.deploy2.class.1=`vendor-provided deployment porting class
* `porting.ts.login.class.1=`vendor-provided login porting class
* `porting.ts.jms.class.1=`vendor-provided JMS porting class
* `porting.ts.tsHttpsURLConnection.class.1=`vendor-provided
HttpsURLConnection-class
* `ri.log.file.location`=location to which RI log files will be written
and optionally stored, if the `harness.log.trace` flag is set to `true` +

[NOTE]
=======================================================================

The `create.interop.tables.only=true` property does not exist in the
`ts.jte` file by default but can be added if needed for creating interop
tables.

For the Java EE 8 RI, you must set `create.cmp.tables=true` when you set
`create.interop.tables.only=true`.

=======================================================================


[NOTE]
=======================================================================

As a general rule, `ts.jte` properties ending with the suffix ".ri" are
RI server properties that rarely need to be changed. Properties ending
with the suffix ".vi" are VI server properties that are more likely to
require modifying.

=======================================================================

3.  Configure both Java EE 8 servers. +
Change to the `<TS_HOME>/bin` directory and run the following Ant
targets: +
[source,oac_no_warn]
----
ant config.ri
ant config.vi
----
If you have not implemented the `config.vi` Ant target for your Java EE
8 server, perform the steps shown in link:#GEWWA[Section 5.3.3,
"Configuring Your Application Server as the VI."]
4.  Configure rebuildable tests, if applicable at this time. +
Java EE 8 CTS Rebuildable Tests are located under
`<TS_HOME>/src/com/sun/ts/tests/jaxws` and
`<TS_HOME>/src/com/sun/ts/tests/jws`. Run this and then continue on to
link:using.html#GBFWO[Chapter 7, "Executing Tests,"] for instructions on
executing tests. If you would like to run tests under
`<TS_HOME>/src/com/sun/ts/tests/interop`, continue to the next step.
5.  Add `<JAVAEE_HOME>/glassfish/modules/ejb-container.jar` to your
application server's `CLASSPATH`. +
This JAR file is part of the EJB interoperability architecture. It
contains implementations of the required system value classes.
6.  Initialize the databases using the appropriate Ant targets.
1.  Log in to the machine running the RI database and execute the
following commands: +
[source,oac_no_warn]
----
cd <TS_HOME>/bin
ant init.javadb
----
2.  Change the `create.interop.tables.only` to false in the
`<TS_HOME>/bin/ts.jte` file.
3.  Log into the machine running the VI database and execute the
following command: +
[source,oac_no_warn]
----
ant init.database
----
Refer to link:database-config.html#GFAVUb[Appendix D, "Configuring Your
Backend Database,"] for detailed database configuration and
initialization instructions and a list of database-specific
initialization targets.
7.  Start the standalone deployment server in a separate shell on the
same host as the CTS harness. +
The default deployment porting implementation goes through a standalone
deployment server with a dedicated classpath. To start this standalone
server, change to the `<TS_HOME>/bin` directory and execute the
`start.auto.deployment.server` Ant task. +
The standalone server is basically an RMI server used to copy archives
to the RI server's `autodeploy` directory. A separate VM is necessary to
avoid classloading conflicts that could occur when the VI server is also
a version of RI server.
8.  If necessary, refer to the sections later in this chapter for
additional configuration information you may require for your particular
test goals. +
For example, see link:#GEXWW[Section 5.4.19, "CSIv2 Test Setup,"] for
configuration settings required for CSIv2 tests.

5.4 Modifying Environment Settings for Specific Technology Tests
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Before you can run any of the technology-specific Java EE 8 CTS tests,
you must supply certain information that JavaTest needs to run the tests
in your particular environment. This information exists in the
`<TS_HOME>/bin/ts.jte` environment file. This file contains sets of
name/value pairs that are used by the tests. You need to assign a valid
value for your environment for all of the properties listed in the
sections that follow.


[NOTE]
=======================================================================

This section only discusses a small subset of the properties you can
modify. Refer to the `ts.jte` file for information about the many other
properties you may want to modify for your particular test environment.

[[GEXQT]][[test-harness-setup]]

5.4.1 Test Harness Setup
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Verify that the following properties, which are used by the test
harness, have been set in the `<TS_HOME>/bin/ts.jte` file:

[source,oac_no_warn]
----
harness.temp.directory=<TS_HOME>/tmp
harness.log.port=2000
harness.log.traceflag=[true | false]
deployment_host.1=<hostname>
deployment_host.2=<hostname>
porting.ts.deploy2.class.1=<vendor-deployment-class>
porting.ts.login.class.1=<vendor-login-class>
porting.ts.url.class.1=<vendor-url-class>
porting.ts.jms.class.1=<vendor-jms-class>
porting.ts.tsHttpsURLConnection.class.1=<vendor-HttpsURLConnection-class>
----

* The `harness.temp.directory` property specifies a temporary directory
that the harness creates and to which the CTS harness and tests write
temporary files. The default setting should not need to be changed.
* The `harness.log.port` property specifies the port that server
components of the tests use to send logging output back to JavaTest. If
the default port is not available on the machine running JavaTest, you
must edit this property and set it to an available port. The default
setting is `2000`.
* The `harness.log.traceflag` property is used to turn on or turn off
verbose debugging output for the tests. The value of the property is set
to `false` by default. Set the property to `true` to turn debugging on.
* The `deployment_host.1` and `deployment_host.2` properties specify the
systems where the vendor's Java Platform, Enterprise Edition server and
the Java Platform, Enterprise Edition RI server are running. By default,
JavaTest will use the `orb.host` and `orb.host.ri` systems, which are
set in the `ts.jte` file.
* The porting class `.1` and `.2` property sets specify the class names
of porting class implementations. By default, both property sets point
to the Java Platform, Enterprise Edition RI-specific classes. To run the
interoperability tests, do not modify the `.2` set. These properties
should always point to the Java Platform, Enterprise Edition RI classes.
Modify the `.1` set to point to implementations that work in your
specific Java Platform, Enterprise Edition environment. See
link:#GEXMH[Configuring a Java Platform, Enterprise Edition RI and VI
for Interop/Rebuildable Tests] for additional information about setting
these properties.
* The `-Dcts.tmp` option for the `testExecute` and
`testExecuteAppClient` commands in the `ts.jte` file have been set. This
Java option tells the test suite the location to which the test suite
will write temporary files.

[[GEXOS]][[windows-specific-properties]]

5.4.2 Windows-Specific Properties
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

When configuring the Java EE 8 CTS for the Windows environment, set the
following properties in `<TS_HOME>/bin/ts.jte`:

* `pathsep` to semicolon (pathsep=`;`)
* `s1as.applicationRoot` to the drive on which you have installed CTS
(for example, `s1as.applicationRoot=C:`) +
When installing in the Windows environment, the Java Platform,
Enterprise Edition RI, JDK, and CTS should all be installed on the same
drive. If you must install these components on different drives, also
change the `ri.applicationRoot` property in addition to the `pathsep`
and `s1as.applicationRoot` properties; for example: +
[source,oac_no_warn]
----
ri.applicationRoot=C:
----


[NOTE]
=======================================================================

When configuring the RI and CTS for the Windows environment, never
specify drive letters in any path properties in `ts.jte`.

=======================================================================


[[GEXPE]][[test-execution-command-setup]]

5.4.3 Test Execution Command Setup
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The test execution command properties are used by the test harness. By
default, the `ts.jte` file defines a single command line for each of the
commands that is used for both UNIX and Windows environments.

* `command.testExecute`
* `command.testExecuteAppClient`
* `command.testExecuteAppClient2`

If these commands do not meet your needs, you can define separate
entries for the UNIX and Windows environments. Edit either the `ts_unix`
or `ts_win32` test execution properties in the `ts.jte` file. For UNIX,
these properties are:

* `env.ts_unix.command.testExecute`
* `env.ts_unix.command.testExecuteAppClient`
* `env.ts_unix.command.testExecuteAppClient2`

For Windows, these properties are:

* `env.ts_win32.command.testExecute`
* `env.ts_win32.command.testExecuteAppClient`
* `env.ts_win32.command.testExecuteAppClient2`

The `testExecute` property specifies the Java command that is used to
execute individual tests from a standalone URL client. Tests in which
the client directly invokes a web component (servlet or JSP), use this
command line since there is no application client container involved.


[NOTE]
=======================================================================

The default settings are specific to the Java Platform, Enterprise
Edition RI. If you are not using the Java Platform, Enterprise Edition
RI, adjust these properties accordingly.

=======================================================================


[[GEXPB]][[servlet-test-setup]]

5.4.4 Servlet Test Setup
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Make sure that the following servlet properties have been set in the
`ts.jte` file:

[source,oac_no_warn]
----
ServletClientThreads=[2X size of default servlet instance pool] 
servlet_waittime=[number_of_milliseconds]
servlet_async_wait=[number_of_seconds]
logical.hostname.servlet=server
s1as.java.endorsed.dirs=${endorsed.dirs}${pathsep}${ts.home}/endorsedlib
----

The `ServletClientThreads` property configures the number of threads
used by the client for the `SingleThreadModel` servlet test. If your
container implementation supports pooling of `SingleThreadModel`
servlets, set the value of the `ServletClientThreads` property to twice
the value of the default servlet instance pool size. If your container
implementation only maintains a single instance of a
`ServletClientThreads` servlet, use the default value of `2`.

The `servlet_waittime` property specifies the amount of time, in
milliseconds, to wait between the time when the `HttpSession` is set to
expire on the server and when the `HttpSession` actually expires on the
client. This time is configurable to allow the servlet container enough
time to completely invalidate the `HttpSession`. The default value is 10
milliseconds.

The test `serverpush` in servlet 4.0, uses `httpclient`, a new library
in JDK9 which is backported to JDK8. There is a restriction on using
`httpclient` in JDK8 as the `httpclient` depends on
java.util.concurrent.flow which is a new class in JDK9. To run the test
on JDK8, use Java Endorsed Standards Override Mechanism and append the
`flow.jar` into bootstrap classpath. This is done by appending the
`<TS_HOME>/endorsedlib` directory to `s1as.java.endorsed.dirs` property
in `ts.jte`.

The `servlet_async_wait` property sets the duration of time in seconds
to wait between sending asynchronous messages. This property is used in
place to test non-interrupted IO, where two messages are sent in two
different batches and the receiving end will be read in a different read
cycle. This property sets the time to wait in seconds on the sending
side. The default is 4 seconds.

The `logical.hostname.servlet` property identifies the configuration
name of the logical host on which the `ServletContext` is deployed. This
used to identify the name of a logical host that processes Java EE 8
requests. Java EE 8 requests may be directed to a logical host using
various physical or virtual host names or addresses, and a message
processing runtime may be composed of multiple logical hosts. The
`logical.hostname.servlet` property is required to properly identify the
Java EE 8 profile's `AppContextId` hostname. This property is used by
the Java EE 8 security tests as well as by the
`ServletContext.getVirtualServerName()` method. If a
`logical.hostname.servlet` does not exist, set this property to the
default hostname (for example, `webServerHost`). The default is
"server".

[[CBDDGJFC]][[websocket-test-setup]]

5.4.5 WebSocket Test Setup
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Make sure that the following WebSocket property has been set in the
`ts.jte` file:

[source,oac_no_warn]
----
ws_wait=[number_of_seconds]
----

The `ws_wait` property configures the wait time, in seconds, for the
socket to send or receive a message. A multiple of 5 of this time is
also used to test socket timeouts.

The WebSocket tests also use the following properties: `webServerHost`
and `webServerPort`. See link:#GEWUI[Section 5.3.2, "Configuring the
Java EE 8 RI as the VI,"] for more information about setting these
properties.


[NOTE]
=======================================================================

The SSL related tests under
/ts/javaeetck/src/com/sun/ts/tests/websocket/platform/javax/websocket/server/handshakerequest/authenticatedssl/
use self signed certificate bundled with the CTS bundle. These
certificates are generated with localhost as the hostname and would work
only when orb.host value is set to localhost in ts.jte. If the server's
hostname is used instead of the localhost, the tests in this suite might
fail with the below exception - javax.websocket.DeploymentException: SSL
handshake has failed.

=======================================================================


[[GEXON]][[jdbc-test-setup]]

5.4.6 JDBC Test Setup
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The JDBC tests require you to set the timezone by modifying the `tz`
property in the `ts.jte` file. On Solaris systems, you can check the
timezone setting by looking in the file `/etc/default/init`. Valid
values for the `tz` property are in the directory
`/usr/share/lib/zoneinfo`. The default setting is `US/Eastern`. This
setting is in `/usr/share/lib/zoneinfo/US`.


[NOTE]
=======================================================================

The `tz` property is only used for Solaris configurations; it does not
apply to Windows XP/2000.

=======================================================================


[[GEXQQ]][[standalone-rmiiiop-server-test-setup]]

5.4.7 Standalone RMI/IIOP Server Test Setup
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The standalone RMI/IIOP server testing verifies that Java Platform,
Enterprise Edition application components can access and communicate
with an external RMI/IIOP server application.

The `start.rmiiiop.server` Ant target uses the `ts.classpath` property
setting from the `ts.jte` file when starting the standalone RMI/IIOP
server application. The standalone RMI/IIOP server application must
start up using the ORB that comes with the Java Platform, Enterprise
Edition RI.

Make sure that `ts.classpath` property contains the Java Platform,
Enterprise Edition RI JAR files and classes and that the following
properties have been set in the `ts.jte` file:

[source,oac_no_warn]
----
rmi.http.server.host=[hostname]
rmi.http.server.port=[port-number]
----

The `rmi.http.server.host` and `rmi.http.server.port` properties must be
set to the host and port where the standalone RMI/IIOP http server is
running. The default values for these properties are `localhost` and
`10000`, respectively.

To start the standalone RMI/IIOP server, execute the following command:

[source,oac_no_warn]
----
ant start.rmiiiop.server
----

[[GEXOT]][[javamail-test-setup]]

5.4.8 JavaMail Test Setup
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Complete the following tasks before you run the JavaMail tests:

1.  Set the following properties in the `ts.jte` file: +
[source,oac_no_warn]
----
mailuser1=[user@domain]
mailFrom=[user@domain]
mailHost=mailserver
javamail.password=password
----
* Set the `mailuser1` property to a valid mail address. Mail messages
generated by the JavaMail tests are sent to the specified address. This
user must be created in the IMAP server.
* Set the `mailFrom` property to a mail address from which mail messages
that the JavaMail tests generate will be sent.
* Set the `mailHost` property to the address of a valid mail server
where the mail will be sent.
* Set the `javamail.password` property to the password for `mailuser1`.
2.  Populate your IMAP server with sample messages. +
Change to the `<TS_HOME>/bin` directory and execute the Ant target
`populateMailbox` to create the sample messages in your IMAP server. +
[source,oac_no_warn]
----

Vendor Implementation. This setup also includes steps for
packaging/repackaging and publishing the packaged/repackaged WAR files
as well.

5.4.9.1 To Configure Your Environment to Run the JAX-RS Tests Against the Java EE 8 RI
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Edit your `<TS_HOME>/bin/ts.jte` file and set the following environment
variables:

1.  Set the `jaxrs_impl_lib` property to point to the JAX-RS RI. +
The default setting for this property is
`${javaee.home}/modules/jersey-container-servlet-core.jar` .
2.  Set the `servlet_adaptor` property to point to the Servlet adaptor
class for the JAX-RS implementation. +
The default setting for this property is
`org/glassfish/jersey/servlet/ServletContainer.class`, the servlet
adaptor supplied in Jersey.
3.  Set the `jaxrs_impl_name` property to the name of the JAX-RS RI. +
The default setting for this property is `jersey`. +
An Ant script, jersey.xml, in the `<TS_HOME>/bin/xml/impl/glassfish`
directory contains packaging instructions.

[[GJYBC]][[to-package-war-files-for-deployment-on-the-java-ee-8-ri]]

5.4.9.2 To Package WAR files for Deployment on the Java EE 8 RI
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

The Java EE 8 CTS test suite does not come with prebuilt test WAR files
for deployment on Java EE 8 RI. The test suite includes a command to
generate the test WAR files that will be deployed on the Java EE 8 RI.
The WAR files are Jersey-specific, with Jersey's servlet class and
Jersey's servlet defined in the `web.xml` deployment descriptor.

To package the JAX-RS WAR files for deployment on the Java EE 8 RI,
complete the following steps:

1.  Change to the `<TS_HOME>/bin` directory.
2.  Execute the `update.jaxrs.wars` Ant target. +
In a test WAR files that has the `servlet_adaptor` property defined,
this target replaces the `servlet_adaptor` value of the servlet class
name property in the `web.xml` file of the WAR files to be deployed on
the Java EE 8 RI.

[[GJYBR]][[to-configure-your-environment-to-run-the-jax-rs-tests-against-a-vendor-implementation]]

5.4.9.3 To Configure Your Environment to Run the JAX-RS Tests Against a Vendor Implementation
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Complete the following steps to configure your test environment to run
the JAX-RS tests against your vendor implementation. Before you can run
the tests, you need to repackage the WAR files that contain the JAX-RS
tests and the VI-specific Servlet class that will be deployed on the
vendor's Java EE 8-compliant application server.

Edit your `<TS_HOME>/bin/ts.jte` file and set the following properties:

1.  Set the `jaxrs_impl_lib` property to point to the JAR file that
contains the vendor's JAX-RS Servlet adaptor implementation. +
The default setting for this property is
`${javaee.home}/modules/jersey-container-servlet-core.jar` .
2.  Set the `servlet_adaptor` property to point to the Servlet adaptor
class for the vendor's JAX-RS implementation. +
The class must be located in the JAR file defined by the
`jaxrs_impl_lib` property. By default, this property is set to
`org/glassfish/jersey/servlet/ServletContainer.class`, the servlet
adaptor supplied in Jersey.
3.  Set the `jaxrs_impl_name` property to the name of the JAX-RS vendor
implementation to be tested. +
The name of the property must be unique. An Ant file bearing this name,
<jaxrs_impl_name>.xml, should be created under
`<TS_HOME>/bin/xml/impl/${impl.vi}` with packaging and/or deployment
instructions as described in link:#GJYDD[Section 5.4.9.4, "To Repackage
WAR files for Deployment on the Vendor Implementation."] +
The default setting for this property is `jersey`.

[[GJYDD]][[to-repackage-war-files-for-deployment-on-the-vendor-implementation]]

5.4.9.4 To Repackage WAR files for Deployment on the Vendor Implementation
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

To run the JAX-RS tests against a vendor's implementation in a Java EE
8-compliant application server, the tests need to be repackaged to
include the VI-specific servlet, and the VI-specific servlet must be
defined in the deployment descriptor.

A vendor must create VI-specific Java EE 8-compliant WAR files so the
VI-specific Servlet class will be included instead of the Java EE 8
RI-specific Servlet class.

All resource and application class files are already compiled. The
Vendor needs to package these files. Java EE 8 CTS makes this task
easier by including template WAR files that contain all of the necessary
files except for the VI-specific servlet adaptor class. The Java EE 8
CTS also provides a tool to help with the repackaging task.

Each test that has a JAX-RS resource class to publish comes with a
template deployment descriptor file. For example, the file
`<TS_HOME>/src/com/sun/ts/tests/jaxrs/ee/rs/get/web.xml.template`
contains the following elements:

[source,oac_no_warn]
----
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>

    </servlet-mapping>
    <session-config>
        <session-timeout>30</session-timeout>
    </session-config>
</web-app>
----

In this example, the `<servlet-class>` element has a value of
`servlet_adaptor`, which is a placeholder for the
implementation-specific Servlet class. A Jersey-specific deployment
descriptor also comes with the Java EE 8, and has the values for the
`com.sun.jersey.spi.container.servlet.ServletContainer`:

The Java EE 8 CTS test suite provides a tool,
`${ts.home}/bin/xml/impl/glassfish/jersey.xml`, for the Java EE 8 RI
that you can use as a model to help you create your own VI-specific Web
test application.

The following steps explain how to create a VI-specific deployment
descriptor.

1.  Create a VI handler file. +
Create a VI-specific handler file
`<TS_HOME>/bin/xml/impl/${impl.vi}/${jaxrs_impl_name}.xml` if one does
not already exist. +
Ensure that the `jaxrs_impl_name` property is set in the `ts.jte` file
and that its name is unique, to prevent another file with the same name
from being overwritten.
2.  Set the `servlet_adaptor` property in the `ts.jte` file. +
This property will be used to set the value of the `<servlet-class>`
element in the deployment descriptor.
3.  Create VI Ant tasks. +
Create a `update.jaxrs.wars` target in the VI handler file. Reference
this `update.jaxrs.wars` target in the `jersey.xml` file. +
This target will create a `web.xml.${jaxrs_impl_name}` for each test
that has a deployment descriptor template. The
`web.xml.${jaxrs_impl_name)` will contain the VI-specific Servlet class
name. It will also create the test WAR files will be created under the
`<TS_HOME>/dist` directory. For example: +
[source,oac_no_warn]
----
cd $TS_HOME/dist/com/sun/ts/tests/jaxrs/ee/rs/get/
ls jaxrs_rs_get_web.war.jersey 
jaxrs_rs_get_web.war.${jaxrs_impl_name}
----
4.  Change to the `<TS_HOME>/bin` directory and execute the
`update.jaxrs.wars` Ant target. +
This creates a `web.xml.${jaxrs_impl_name}` file for each test based on
the VI's servlet class name and repackages the tests.

[[GEXOF]][[connector-test-setup]]

5.4.10 Connector Test Setup
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The Connector tests verify that a Java EE 8 server correctly implements
the Connector V1.7 specification. The Connector compatibility tests
ensure that your Java EE 8 server still supports the Connector V1.0
functionality.

The `config.vi` target is run to configure the Java EE 8 server for
running Connector tests. The `config.vi` target calls the
`config.connecto`r target, which is defined in
`TS_HOME/bin/xml/impl/glassfish/s1as.xml`, to deploy the RAR files
listed in link:#GJVGT[Section 5.4.10.1, "Extension Libraries."] and
create the required connection resources and connection pools used for
the Connector tests. The `config.vi` target also performs several other
tasks, such as creating required users and security mappings, setting
appropriate JVM options, etc. that also are needed to run the Connector
tests.

[[GJVGT]][[extension-libraries]]

=======================================================================

RAR files with an `old` prefix are used to test the support of RAs that
are bundled with an older version of the `ra.xml` files.

=======================================================================


The manifest file in each RAR file includes a reference to the whitebox
extension library. The `whitebox.jar` file is a Shared Library that must
be deployed as a separate entity that all the Connector RAR files
access. This extension library is needed to address classloading issues.

The RAR files that are used withJava EE 8 CTS test suite differ from
those that were used in earlier test suites. Java EE 8 CTS no longer
bundles the same common classes into every RAR file. Duplicate common
classes have been removed and now exist in the `whitebox.jar` file, an
Installed Library that is deployed and is made available before any
other RAR files are deployed.

This was done to address the following compatibility issues:

* Portable use of Installed Libraries for specifying a resource
adapter's shared libraries +
See section EE.8.2.2 of the Java EE 8 platform specification and section
20.2.0.1 in the JCA 1.7 specification, which explicitly state that the
resource adapter server may employ the library mechanisms in Java EE 8.
* Support application-based standalone connector accessibility +
Section 20.2.0.4 of the JCA 1.7 Specification uses the classloading
requirements that are listed in section 20.3 in the specification.

[[GJVGO]][[connector-resource-adapters-and-classloading]]

5.4.10.2 Connector Resource Adapters and Classloading
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Java EE 8 CTS has scenarios in which multiple standalone RAR files that
use the same shared library (for example, `whitebox.jar`) are referenced
from an application component.

Each standalone RAR file gets loaded in its own classloader. Since the
application component refers to more than one standalone RAR file, all
of the referenced standalone RAR files need to be made available in the
classpath of the application component. In versions of the TCK prior to
Java EE 5, since each standalone RAR file contained a copy of the
`whitebox.jar` file, every time there was a reference to a class in the
`whitebox.jar` file from a standalone RAR, the reference was resolved by
using the private version of `whitebox.jar` (the `whitebox.jar` file was
bundled in each standalone RAR file). This approach can lead to class
type inconsistency issues.

[[GJVHD]][[use-case-problem-scenario]]

5.4.10.3 Use Case Problem Scenario
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Assume that RAR1 and RAR2 are standalone RAR files that are referred to
by an application, where:

* RAR1's classloader has access to RAR1's classes and its copy of
`whitebox.jar`. (RAR1's classloader contains RAR1's classes and
`whitebox.jar`)
* RAR2's classloader has access to RAR2's classes and its copy of
`whitebox.jar`. (RAR2's classloader contains RAR2's classes and
`whitebox.jar`)

When the application refers to both of these RAR files, a classloader
that encompasses both of these classloaders (thereby creating a
classloader search order) is provided to the application. The
classloader search order could have the following sequence: ([RAR1's
Classloader: RAR1's classes and whitebox.jar], [RAR2's Classloader:
RAR2's classes and whitebox.jar]).

In this scenario, when an application loads a class (for example, class
`Foo`) in `whitebox.jar`, the application gets class `Foo` from RAR1's
classloader because that is first in the classloader search order.
However, when this is cast to a class (for example, `Foo` or a subclass
of `Foo` or even a class that references `Foo`) that is obtained from
RAR2's classloader (a sequence that is typically realized in a
`ConnectionFactory` lookup), this would result in a class-cast
exception.

The portable way of solving the issues raised by this use case problem
scenario is to use installed libraries, as described in section EE.8.2.2
in the Java EE 8 platform specification. If both RAR files (RAR1 and
RAR2) reference `whitebox.jar` as an installed library and the
application server can use a single classloader to load this common
dependency, there will be no type-related issues.

In the RI, `domain-dir/lib/applibs` is used as the Installed Library
directory and is the location to which the `whitebox.jar` file gets
copied.

[[GJVHK]][[required-porting-package]]

5.4.10.4 Required Porting Package
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

The Java EE 8 CTS test suite treats the `whitebox.jar` dependency as an
Installed Library dependency instead of bundling the dependency (or
dependencies) with every RAR file. Each RAR file now contains a
reference to the `whitebox.jar` file through its Manifest files
Extension-List attribute.

It is necessary to identify the `whitebox.jar` to the connector server
as an installed library. The mechanism used to identify the
`whitebox.jar` file to the connector server as an Installed Library must
allow the Installed Libraries to have dependencies on Java EE APIs. In
other words, because the `whitebox.jar` file depends on Java EE APIs,
one cannot simply put the `whitebox.jar` file into a `java.ext.dir`
directory , which gets loaded by the VM extension classloader, because
that mechanism does not allow the `whitebox.jar` file to support its
dependencies on the Java EE APIs. For this reason, the Installed Library
must support access to the Java EE APIs.

See section EE.8.2.2 in the Java EE 8 platform specification for
information about the reference implementation's support for Installed
libraries. However, note that this section does not recommend a
mechanism that a deployer can use to provide Installed Libraries in a
portable manner.

[[GJVHH]][[creating-security-mappings-for-the-connector-rar-files]]

5.4.10.5 Creating Security Mappings for the Connector RAR Files
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

The Ant target `create.security.eis.mappings` in the
`<TS_HOME>/bin/xml/impl/glassfish/connector.xml` file maps Resource
Adapter user information to existing user information in the RI.

For the RI, these mappings add a line to the `domain.xml` file, similar
to the one shown below, and should include 6 of these mappings:

[source,oac_no_warn]
----
<jvm-options>-Dwhitebox-tx-map=cts1=j2ee</jvm-options>
<jvm-options>-Dwhitebox-tx-param-map=cts1=j2ee</jvm-options>

<jvm-options>-Dwhitebox-xa-map=cts1=j2ee</jvm-options>
<jvm-options>-Dwhitebox-xa-param-map=cts1=j2ee</jvm-options>
----

If the `rauser1` property has been set to `cts1` and the `user` property
has been set to `j2ee` in the `ts.jte` file, the following mappings
would be required in the connector runtime:

* For RA `whitebox-tx`, map `cts1` to `j2ee`
* For RA `whitebox-tx-param`, map `cts1` to `j2ee`
* For RA `whitebox-notx`, map `cts1` to `j2ee`
* For RA `whitebox-notx-param`, map `cts1` to `j2ee`
* For RA `whitebox-xa`, map `cts1` to `j2ee`

Create the required JVM options that enable user information to be set

some of the property settings in the `ts.jte` file.

To see some of the required JVM options for the server under test, see

[[GEXPV]][[xa-test-setup]]

5.4.11 XA Test Setup
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The XA Test setup requires that the `ejb_Tsr.ear` file be deployed as
part of the `config.vi` Ant target. The `ejb_Tsr.ear` file contains an
embedded RAR file, which requires the creation of a connection-pool and
a connector resource.

For more details about the deployment of `ejb_Tsr.ear` and its
corresponding connection pool and connector resource values, see the
`setup.tsr.embedded.rar` Ant target in the
`<TS_HOME>/bin/xml/impl/glassfish/s1as.xml` file.

The XA tests reference some `JDBCWhitebox` name bindings that are
created as part of the `config.vi` target but those name bindings are
not tied to any JDBC RAR files. Instead, the following XA-specific
connection pool ids are referenced by the XA tests:

* `eis/JDBCwhitebox-xa`
* `eis/JDBCwhitebox-tx`
* `eis/JDBCwhitebox-notx`

For more details on these JDBC resources, examine the
`add.jdbc.resources` target in the same file to see the required JDBC
resources that are created. Both targets are called as part of the
`config.vi` target.

Complete the following steps (create JDBC connection pools and JDBC
resource elements, deploy the RAR files) to set up your environment to
run the XA tests:

1.  Create a JDBC connection pool with the following attributes:
* Set the resource type to `javax.sql.XADataSource`
* Set the datasourceclassname to
`org.apache.derby.jdbc.EmbeddedXADataSource`
* Set the property to
`DatabaseName=<Derby- location>:user=cts1:password=cts1`
* Set the connection pool name to `cts-derby-XA-pool` +
For example, you could use the `asadmin` command line utility in the
Java EE 8 RI to create this connection pool: +
[source,oac_no_warn]
----
asadmin create-jdbc-connection-pool --restype javax.sql.XADataSource \
--datasourceclassname org.apache.derby.jdbc.EmbeddedXADataSource  \
--property 'DatabaseName=/tmp/DerbyDB:user=cts1:password=cts1' \
cts-derby-XA-pool
----
See the `add.jdbc.pools` Ant target in the `s1as.xml` file for
additional information.
2.  Create three JDBC connection pool elements (more specifically, the
JDBC connection pool elements) with the following JNDI names:
* For the first connection pool element, set the connection pool id to
`cts-derby-XA-pool` and the JNDI name to `eis/JDBCwhitebox-xa`
* For the second connection pool element, set the connection pool id to
`cts-derby-XA-pool` and the JNDI name to `eis/JDBCwhitebox-tx`
* For the third connection pool element, set the connection pool id to
`cts-derby-XA-pool` and the JNDI name to `eis/JDBCwhitebox-notx` +
For example, you could use the `asadmin` command line utility in the
Java EE 8 RI to create the three connection pool elements: +
[source,oac_no_warn]
----
asadmin  asadmin  create-jdbc-resource --connectionpoolid cts-derby-XA-pool \
 eis/JDBCwhitebox-xa
asadmin  create-jdbc-resource --connectionpoolid cts-derby-XA-pool \
 eis/JDBCwhitebox-tx
asadmin  create-jdbc-resource --connectionpoolid cts-derby-XA-pool \
 eis/JDBCwhitebox-notx
----
If two or more JDBC resource elements point to the same connection pool
element, they use the same pool connection at runtime. Java EE 8 CTS
does reuse the same connection pool ID for testing the Java EE 8 RI.
3.  Make sure that the following EIS and RAR files have been deployed
into your environment before you run the XA tests:
* For the EIS resource adapter, deploy the following RAR files. Most of
these files are standalone RAR files, but there is also an embedded RAR
file that is contained in the `ejb_Tsr.ear` file. With the RI, these RAR
files are deployed as part of the config.vi Ant task. The following RAR
files are defined in the `ts.jte` file. +
[source,oac_no_warn]
----
whitebox-tx=java:comp/env/eis/whitebox-tx
whitebox-notx=java:comp/env/eis/whitebox-notx

whitebox-embed-xa=
"__SYSTEM/resource/ejb_Tsr#whitebox-xa#com.sun.ts.tests.common.connector.whitebox.TSConnectionFactory"
----
* The embedded RAR files are located in the
`<TS_HOME>/src/com/sun/ts/tests/xa/ee/tsr` directory.
* The EIS RAR files are located in the following directory:
`<TS_HOME>/src/com/sun/ts/tests/common/connector/whitebox` +
RAR files in the `<TS_HOME>/src/com/sun/ts/tests/common/connector`
directory must be built before any dependent tests can pass. Deployment
can either be done ahead of time or at runtime, as long as connection
pools and resources are established prior to test execution. +
The XA tests make use of existing connector RAR files, which typically
get deployed when the `config.vi` Ant task is run. Note that there are
currently no `JDBCwhitebox` source files and no `JDNCwhitebox` RAR
files.

5.4.12 EJB 3.2 Test Setup
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This section explains special configuration that needs to be completed
before running the EJB 3.2 DataSource and Stateful Timeout tests.

The EJB 3.2 DataSource tests do not test XA capability and XA support in
a database product is typically not required for these tests. However,
some Java EE products could be implemented in such a way that XA must be
supported by the database. For example, when processing the
@DataSourceDefinition annotation or `<data-source>` descriptor elements
in tests, a Java EE product infers the datasource type from the
interface implemented by the driver class. When the driver class
implements multiple interfaces, such as `javax.sql.DataSource`,
`javax.sql.ConnectionPoolDataSource`, or `javax.sql.XADataSource`, the
vendor must choose which datasource type to use. If
`javax.sql.XADataSource` is chosen, the target datasource system must be
configured to support XA. Consult the documentation for your database
system and JDBC driver for information that explains how to enable XA
support.

* `com/sun/ts/tests/ejb30/lite/packaging/war/datasource`
* `com/sun/ts/tests/ejb30/misc/datasource`
* `com/sun/ts/tests/ejb30/assembly/appres`

If your database vendor requires you to set any vendor-specific or less
common DataSource properties, complete step link:#BABDIIGI[1] and then
complete step link:#BABBGJAF[2], as explained below.

1.  [[BABDIIGI]] +
Set any vendor-specific or less common datasource properties with the

The EJB 3.2 Stateful Timeout Tests in the following test directories
require special setup:

* `com/sun/ts/tests/ejb30/lite/stateful/timeout`
* `com/sun/ts/tests/ejb30/bb/session/stateful/timeout`

1.  Set the `javatest.timeout.factor` property in the `ts.jte` file to a
value such that the JavaTest harness does not time out before the test
completes. +
A value of 2.0 or greater should be sufficient.
2.  Set the `test.ejb.stateful.timeout.wait.seconds` property, which
specifies the minimum amount of time, in seconds, that the test client
waits before verifying the status of the target stateful bean, to a
value that is appropriate for your server. +
The value of this property must be an integer number. The default value
is 480 seconds. This value can be set to a smaller number (for example,
240 seconds) to speed up testing, depending on the stateful timeout
implementation strategy in the target server.

[[GEXOX]][[ejb-timer-test-setup]]

5.4.13 EJB Timer Test Setup
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Set the following properties in the `ts.jte` file to configure the EJB
timer tests:

[source,oac_no_warn]
----
ejb_timeout=[interval_in_milliseconds]
ejb_wait=[interval_in_milliseconds]
----

* The `ejb_timeout` property sets the duration of single-event and
interval timers. The default setting and recommended minimum value is
`30000` milliseconds.
* The `ejb_wait` property sets the period for the test client to wait
for results from the `ejbTimeout()` method. The default setting and
recommended minimum value is `60000` milliseconds.

Java EE 8 CTS does not have a property that you can set to configure the
date for date timers.

The timer tests use the specific `jndi-name` jdbc`/DBTimer` for the
datasource used for container-managed persistence to support the use of
an XA datasource in the Java EE 8 timer implementation. For example:

[source,oac_no_warn]
----
<jdbc-resource enabled="true" jndi-name="jdbc/DBTimer" 
               object-type="user" pool-name="cts-javadb-XA-pool" />

[[GEXQB]][[entity-bean-container-managed-persistence-test-setup-for-ejb-v1.1]]

5.4.14 Entity Bean Container-Managed Persistence Test Setup for EJB V1.1
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Your Java Platform, Enterprise Edition implementation should map the
following instance variables to a backend datastore. These are needed to
run the CTS entity bean container-managed persistence (cmp1.1) tests.

The Java Platform, Enterprise Edition RI creates the table used by
container-managed persistence by appending `"Table"` to the bean name.
For example, if your bean name is `TestEJB`, the table that will be
created will be `TestEJBTable`.

The container-managed fields for most `cmp` tests must have the
following names and the following Java types:

[width="100%",cols="50%,50%",options="header",]
|======================
|Column Name |Java Type
|`key_id` |Integer
|`brand_name` |String
|`price` |Float
|======================


These instance variable names correspond to the following database
schema:

[source,oac_no_warn]
----
KEY_ID (INTEGER NOT NULL)
BRAND_NAME (VARCHAR(32))
PRICE (FLOAT)
PRIMARY KEY (KEY_ID)
----

These instance variables are used in the transactional entity test bean
for the transactional test cases (`tx`) and in the database support
utility class for the bean behavior test cases (`bb`). These instance
variables, used in the enterprise bean tests, must be accessible at
deployment time.

The Java Platform, Enterprise Edition RI provides the container-managed
persistence implementation-specific features as part of its runtime XML
file. Your Java Platform, Enterprise Edition platform implementation
needs to map the container-managed fields to the appropriate backend
datastore. The manner in which you do this is implementation-specific.
The `DeploymentInfo` class provides all of the runtime XML information
as an object that is passed to the `TSDeploymentInterface2`
implementation.

The JPA Pluggability tests under the
`src/com/sun/ts/tests/jpa/ee/pluggability` directory ensure that a
third-party persistence provider is pluggable, in nature.

After Java EE 7 CTS, the pluggability tests were rewritten to use a
stubbed-out JPA 2.1 implementation, which is located in the
`src/com/sun/ts/jpa/common/pluggibility/altprovider` directory.

In Java EE 7 CTS, the Persistence API pluggability tests required
special setup to run. This is no longer the case, since Java EE 8 CTS
now enables the pluggability tests to be executed automatically along
with all the other Persistence tests. The Persistence tests have a new
directory structure. In Java EE 7 CTS, the tests were in the
`src/com/sun/ts/tests/ejb30/persistence` directory. The tests are now in
the `src/com/sun/ts/tests/jpa` directory.

[[sthref19]][[enabling-second-level-caching-support]]

controls the CTS test suite's use of the second-level cache.

The `persistence.second.level.caching.supported` property is used to

[[GEXOW]][[persistence-test-vehicles]]

5.4.15.3 Persistence Test Vehicles
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

The persistence tests are run in a variety of "vehicles" from which the
entity manager is obtained and the transaction type is defined for use.
There are six vehicles used for these tests:

* `stateless3`: Bean-managed stateless session bean using JNDI to lookup
a JTA `EntityManager`; uses `UserTransaction` methods for transaction
demarcation
* `stateful3`: Container-managed stateful session bean using
`@PersistenceContext` annotation to inject JTA `EntityManager;` uses
container-managed transaction demarcation with a transaction attribute
(required)
* `appmanaged`: Container-managed stateful session bean using
`@PersistenceUnit` annotation to inject an `EntityManagerFactory`; the
`EntityManagerFactory` API is used to create an Application-Managed JTA
`EntityManager`, and uses the container to demarcate transactions
* `appmanagedNoTx`: Container-managed stateful session bean using
`@PersistenceUnit` annotation to inject an `EntityManagerFactory`; the
`EntityManagerFactory` API is used to create an Application-Managed
Resource Local `EntityManager`, and uses the `EntityTransaction` APIs to
control transactions
* `pmservlet`: Servlet that uses the `@PersistenceContext` annotation at
the class level and then uses JNDI lookup to obtain the `EntityManager`;
alternative to declaring the persistence context dependency via a
`persistence-context-ref` in `web.xml` and uses `UserTransaction`
methods for transaction demarcation
* `puservlet`: Servlet that injects an `EntityManagerFactory` using the
`@PersistenceUnit` annotation to create a to Resource Local
`EntityManager`, and uses `EntityTransaction` APIs for transaction
demarcation


[NOTE]
=======================================================================

For vehicles using a `RESOURCE_LOCAL` transaction type, be sure to
configure a non-transactional resource with the logical name
`jdbc/DB_no_tx`. Refer to the `ts.jte` file for information about the
`jdbc.db` property.

=======================================================================


[[GEXPY]][[generatedvalue-annotation]]

5.4.15.4 GeneratedValue Annotation
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

The Java Persistence API Specification also defines the requirements for
the `GeneratedValue` annotation. The default for this annnotation is
`GenerationType.AUTO`. Per the specification, `AUTO` indicates that the
persistence provider should pick an appropriate strategy for the
particular database. The `AUTO` generation strategy may expect a
database resource to exist, or it may attempt to create one.

The `db.supports.sequence` property is used to determine if a database
supports the use of SEQUENCE. If it does not, this property should be
set to false so the test is not run. The default value is true.

If the database under test is not one of the databases defined and
supported by CTS, the user will need to create an entry similar to the
one listed in link:#GEXOO[Example 5-1].

[[GEXOO]]

Example 5-1 GeneratedValue Annotation Test Table

You should add your own table to your chosen database DDL file provided
prior to running these tests. The Data Model used to test the Java
Persistence Query Language can be found in
link:ejbql-schema.html#GFAVUc[Appendix E, "EJBQL Schema."]

The `persistence.xml` file, which defines a persistence unit, contains
the `unitName` `CTS-EM` for JTA entity managers. This corresponds to
`jta-data-source`, `jdbc/DB1`, and to `CTS-EM-NOTX` for `RESOURCE_LOCAL`
entity managers, which correspond to a `non-jta-data-source`

^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Using two Java Platform, Enterprise Edition server implementations, you
can test up to four transaction interoperability configurations.
However, note that you only need to test and pass configurations that
your Java Platform, Enterprise Edition server supports.
link:#GEXOC[Table 5-1] shows these configurations.

Modify the interoperability settings for transaction interoperability
according to what you need to test:

* If your implementation supports transaction interoperability, you must
test configurations #1 and #2.
* If your implementation does not support transaction interoperability,
you must test configurations #3 and #4.

The `ts.jte` file has the following transaction interoperability
properties:

[[GKWVB]][[jaspic-test-setup]]

5.4.18 JASPIC Test Setup
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Java Authentication Service Provider Interface for Containers (JASPIC)
1.1 tests are security tests. The JASPIC Servlet profile is the only
required profile for Java EE 8 CTS. There are other optional profile
tests, such as SOAP, but you are not required to run these for
certification.

The test suite includes the following Ant targets that configure the
test environment for the JASPIC tests

* `config_vi` target in `<TS_HOME>/bin/build.xml`
* `enable.jaspic`, also in `<TS_HOME>/bin/build.xml`

Both targets call `<TS_HOME>/bin/xml/impl/glassfish/javaee_vi.xml`,
which then makes calls into `<TS_HOME>/bin/xml/impl/glassfish/s1as.xml`.
You may want to examine these targets to see what is done in greater
detail.

Complete the following steps before you run the JASPIC tests:

1.  Configure the JASPIC-required properties in the `ts.jte` file:
1.  Set the `provider.configuration.file` property to the location of
your implementation's instance `lib` directory, where it can be loaded
when your implementation runtime is started. +
This file typically coexists with the `tssv.jar` file and the
`provider-configuration.dtd` file.
2.  Set the `vendor.authconfig.factory` property to specify your
`AuthConfigFactory` class. +
This property setting will be used by the JASPIC tests to register the
test suite's provider in your `AuthConfigFactory`.
3.  Set the `logical.hostname.servlet` property to the logical host that
will process Servlet requests. +
Servlet requests may be directed to a logical host using various
physical or virtual host names or addresses. A message processing
runtime may be composed of multiple logical hosts. This setting is
required to properly identify the Servlet profile's application context
identifier hostname. If the logical host that will process Servlet
requests does not exist, you can set this to the default hostname of
your implementation's Web server.
4.  Set the `servlet.is.jsr115.compatible` property based on whether or
not you are running the Servlet profile in a JSR 115-compatible
container.
2.  Ensure that the `config.vi` Ant task has been run before running the
`enable.jaspic` Ant task. +
These Ant tasks perform the following JASPIC-required steps:
* Set up users and passwords for your implementation. +
See Step link:#BABDADHA[9]link:#BABBHFAI[b] in link:#GEWWA[Configuring
Your Application Server as the VI] for more information.
* Install the client-side certificate in the `trustStore` in your
implementation. +
See Step link:#BABEGCJH[17] in link:#GEWWA[Configuring Your Application
Server as the VI] for more information.
* Append the file `<TS_HOME>/bin/server_policy.append` to the Java
policy file or files on your implementation. +
See Step 17 in link:#GEWWA[Configuring Your Application Server as the
VI]link:#GEWWA[Configuring Your Application Server as the VI] for more
information.
* Appends the file `<TS_HOME>/bin/client_policy.append` to the
application client's Java policy file, which is referenced in the
`TestExecuteAppClient` section of the `ts.jte` file. +
See Step 18 in link:#GEWWA[Configuring Your Application Server as the
VI]link:#GEWWA[Configuring Your Application Server as the VI] for more
information.
* Copies the `<TS_HOME>/lib/tssv.jar` file to your implementation
instance library directory. +
The `tssv.jar` file includes the class files necessary to load
`TSAuthConfigFactory` and related classes.
* Copies the TSSV configuration files (`ProviderConfiguration.xml`,
`configuration.dtd`) to your implementation instance library directory. +
The `provider-configuration.dtd` file is a DTD file that resides in the
same directory as the `ProviderConfiguration.xml` file and describes the
`ProviderConfiguration.xml` file. This file should not be edited.
* Copies `<TS_HOME>/bin/ts.java.security` to
`<JAVAEE_HOME>/domains/domain1/config/ts.java.security`, where
`<JAVAEE_HOME>` is the location of your Java EE 8 RI installation.
* Sets the following JVM options:

** `-Djava.security.properties=<JAVAEE_HOME>/domains/domain1/config/ts.java.security`

** `-Dlog.file.location=${log.file.location}`

** `-Dprovider.configuration.file=${provider.configuration.file}`
3.  Deploy the JASPIC log file processor,
`<TS_HOME>/dist/com/sun/ts/tests/jaspic/util/jaspic_util_web.war`, to
the implementation under test. +

[NOTE]
=======================================================================

It may be necessary to restart your implementation after completing this
step.

=======================================================================

4.  Run the tests for the profiles with which you are trying to certify.
5.  After running the JASPIC tests, change back to the `<TS_HOME>/bin`
directory and execute the following command: +
[source,oac_no_warn]
----
cd <TS_HOME>/bin
ant disable.jaspic
----
This Ant task undoes the changes that were made to your implementation
by the `enable.jaspic` target. If these changes are not reversed, your
implementation may be left in an uncertain state.

Common Secure Interoperability Version 2 (CSIv2) is security-related
interoperability testing. You must complete all of the setup
instructions in link:#GEXMH[Configuring a Java Platform, Enterprise
Edition RI and VI for Interop/Rebuildable Tests] and the steps provided
in this section before you run the CSIv2 tests.

This following sections describe how to set up two Java Platform,

[[GLREL]][[generating-iors-based-on-runtime-xml-information]]

5.4.19.3 Generating IORs Based on Runtime XML Information
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

The `DeploymentInfo` class contains public accessor methods that
correspond to XML elements within the `<ior-security-config>` element in
the EJB jar runtime XML that is packaged with the test beans. Java
Platform, Enterprise Edition vendor implementations are required to
generate IORs that are based on the values pulled from this XML document
as described in this section. Failure to do so will result in test
failures.

The fields are divided into three categories:

* Fields that deal with client authentication at the client
authentication layer of the CSIv2 protocol:

** `asAuthMethod`

** `asRequired`

** `asRealmName`
* Fields that deal with the secure transport layer (SSL):

** `transportIntegrity`

** `transportConfidentiality`

** `EstablishTrustInTarget`

** `EstablishTrustInClient`
* Fields that deal with caller propagation:

** `sasCallerPropagation`

The values of these fields must be used to construct the
`CompoundSecMec` structure within an IOR. The construction of the IORs
is briefly described in this class. link:csiv2logs.html#GFKKB[IORs and
Associated CSIv2 Tests] lists all the IORS that are expected to be
generated. For more detailed information about IORS, refer to the CSIv2
specification.

Not all possible combinations of fields are used by CSIv2 tests. For
example, the following fields are used to indicate that client
authentication is required at the client authentication layer of the
CSIv2 protocol:

[source,oac_no_warn]
----
asAuthMethod = "username_password"
asRealmName  = "default"
asRequired   = "true"
----

The following fields are used to indicate that client authentication is
not required at the client authentication layer of the CSIv2 protocol:

[source,oac_no_warn]
----
asAuthMethod = "username_password"
asRealmName  = "default"
asRequired   = "false"
----

The Java example listed below demonstrates how users can extract the
required information from the `DeploymentInfo` object:

[source,oac_no_warn]
----
DeploymentInfo info;
List ejbs = info.getEnterpriseBeans().getEjb();
foreach ejb in ejbs {
    ejb.getIorSecurityConfig().getAsContext().getAuthMethod().getContent();
    ejb.getIorSecurityConfig().getAsContext().getRequired().getContent();
    ejb.getIorSecurityConfig().getAsContext().getRealm().getContent();
    ejb.getIorSecurityConfig().getTransportConfig().getIntegrity().getContent();
    ejb.getIorSecurityConfig().getTransportConfig().getConfidentiality().getContent();
    ejb.getIorSecurityConfig().getTransportConfig().getEstablishTrustInClient().getContent();
    ejb.getIorSecurityConfig().getTransportConfig().getEstablishTrustInTarget().getContent();
} // end loop

[[GEYBI]][[jacc-test-setup]]

5.4.20 JACC Test Setup
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To comply with Java EE 8 requirements, JACC must be supported in both
the Web and EJB environments. The tests for each environment are divided
into two directories:

* `src/com/sun/ts/tests/jacc/web`
* `src/com/sun/ts/tests/jacc/ejb`

When deploying the archives that contain JACC tests, don't deploy all
the JACC test archives at the same time. While this may work, there have
been times when it has caused problems. The recommended course of action
is to deploy the test archive for the directory under test. Once done,
remove that archive and move onto another directory.

The JACC-CTS provider acts as a delegating security provider sitting
between the appserver and vendor provider. The Java Platform, Enterprise
Edition appserver comes with a default security provider that is defined
by two system properties; for the purposes of this discussion, these are
referred to as `A=DefaultProviderFactory` and `B=DefaultPolicyModule`.

CTS moves the values from A and B to two new variables:
`C=DefaultProviderFactory` and `D=DefaultPolicyModule`, replacing the
CTS provider classes to the variables `A` and `B` (`A=TSProviderFactory`
and `B=TSPolicyModule`). This modification allows the server to call the
CTS provider for all its functions, and the CTS provider in turn uses
these new variables to invoke the real provider.

The property names `A`, `B`, `C`, and `D` are used for convenience here.
The real property names are as follows:

* `A=javax.security.jacc.PolicyConfigurationFactory.provider`
* `B=javax.security.jacc.policy.provider`
* `C=vendor.javax.security.jacc.PolicyConfigurationFactory.provider`
* `D=vendor.javax.security.jacc.policy.provider`

To configure the JACC provider for the Java Platform, Enterprise Edition
RI, execute the JACC Ant target from:

[source,oac_no_warn]
----
<TS_HOME>/bin
----

This command does the following:

* Switches the system properties.
* Adds `tsprovider.jar` to Java Platform, Enterprise Edition application
server's classpath.
* Adds `log.file.location` system property to the Java Platform,
Enterprise Edition application server's system properties. This is used
for generating log files, which is used for verifying JSR 115 contracts.


[NOTE]
=======================================================================

When running JACC tests against the Java EE 8 RI, if you need to restart
the RI, be sure to first remove all JACC log files (`jacc_log.*`) from
the `JAVAEE_HOME/domains/domain1/logs` directory before running the JACC
tests again.

5.4.21 Java Batch Test Setup
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The Java Batch tests, which are located under the
`<TS_HOME>/src/com/ibm/jbatch/tck` directory, don't require extra setup
for most implementations. However, there may be a few cases where some
customization is needed.

If you are using an injection technology other than CDI, complete the
following steps before running the Java Batch tests:

1.  Remove the `<TS_HOME>/src/com/ibm/jbatch/tck/testJobXml/beans.xml`
and `<TS_HOME>/src/com/ibm/jbatch/tck/tests/ee/beans.xml` files.
2.  Change to the `<TS_HOME>/src/com/ibm/jbatch/tck` directory.
3.  Execute the `ant build` command to rebuild the archives.

If you are using a different implementation of the porting interface
`<<TS_HOME>/src/com/ibm/jbatch/tck/testJobXml/META-INF/services/com.ibm.jbatch.tck.spi.JobExecutionWaiterFactory`,
complete the following steps before running the Java Batch tests:

1.  Change the entry in
`<TS_HOME>/src/com/ibm/jbatch/tck/testJobXml/META-INF/services/com.ibm.jbatch.tck.spi.JobExecutionWaiterFactory`
to specify the new porting implementation class.
2.  Change to the `<TS_HOME>/src/com/ibm/jbatch/tck` directory.
3.  Execute the `ant build` command to rebuild the archives.

[[GEYAM]][[wsdl-webservice-test-and-runtime-notes]]

5.4.22 WSDL: Webservice Test and Runtime Notes
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

In addition to the WSDL elements described later in this section, the
Java Platform, Enterprise Edition RI webservice runtime DTDs contain two
new optional elements for publishing and lookup of final WSDLs for a
deployed webservice endpoint. These new tags are
`<wsdl-publish-location>` and `<wsdl-override>`, and are used by the CTS
to automate all CTS webservices tests, regardless of the host or port
used to run the tests.

These WSDL tags are also used when performing file URL publishing, as
required by JSR109. JSR109 states that http URL and file URL publishing
must be supported on a Java Platform, Enterprise Edition platform. In
addition, the `<wsdl-override>` is used as a mechanism for satisfying
the partial WSDL requirement in the JSR109 specification. This mechanism
enables the specification of the location of the final full published
WSDL of a deployed webservice endpoint within the client EAR when only a
partial WSDL is packaged, which enables client access to the full WSDL
and correct SOAP address to communicate with the webservice.

The `<wsdl-publish-location>` tag tells the Java Platform, Enterprise
Edition RI where to publish the final WSDL for the deployed webservice
endpoint. As stated above, the final WSDL can be published to a file URL
or http URL, although the tag is really only necessary for file URL
publishing, and is ignored if http URL publishing is specified (http is
the default publishing used by the Java Platform, Enterprise Edition
RI). This tag is included in all CTS tests for consistency and to aid as
a mechanism in automation.

By default, the Java Platform, Enterprise Edition RI publishes the final
WSDL during deployment to a http URL following a standard URL naming
scheme. See below for details about the Java Platform, Enterprise
Edition RI runtime. This default can be overriden to explicitly do file
URL publishing.

The `<wsdl-override>` tag tells the client application EAR where to
lookup the final published WSDL for the deployed webservice endpoint.
This will be either a `file` URL or an `http` URL to match what is
specified in the `<wsdl-publish-location>` tag.

[[GEYAJ]][[wsdl-ts.jte-properties]]

5.4.22.1 WSDL ts.jte Properties
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

For file URL publishing, the CTS defines two properties in the `ts.jte`
file, named `wsdlRepository1` and `wsdlRepository2`, which specify the
file system directory location to use for publishing final WSDLs that
use file URL publishing.

The `wsdlRepository1` is used for the Vendor Java Platform, Enterprise
Edition Implementation. The `wsdlRepository2` is used for the RI Java
Platform, Enterprise Edition Implementation, and is only used for CTS
webservices interoperability testing. These directories get created by
the CTS harness at runtime. The default settings in the `ts.jte` file
will create these directories under:

[source,oac_no_warn]
----
wsdlRepository1=<TS_HOME>/tmp/wsdlRepository1
wsdlRepository2=<TS_HOME>/tmp/wsdlRepository2

For file URL publishing, the WSDL tag settings could be as follows:

----
$TS_HOME/src/com/sun/ts/tests/webservices/wsdlImport/file/Simple1

5.4.22.2 Webservice Endpoint WSDL Elements
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

The following are the webservice endpoint WSDL elements:

[[GEYMW]][[setting-endpoint-address]]

5.4.22.2.1 Setting Endpoint Address

[source,oac_no_warn]
----
element : endpoint-address-uri
----

The endpoint address URI is used to compose the endpoint address URL
through which the endpoint can be accessed. It is required for EJB
endpoints and optional for servlet endpoints.

The `endpoint-address-uri` can have an optional leading forward slash
(`/`). It must be a fixed pattern (no asterisk (`*`) wildcards).

* EJB Example: +
For EJB endpoints, the URI is relative to root of the web server; for
example, if the web server is listening at `http://localhost:8000`, an
endpoint address URI of `google/GoogleSearch` would result in an
endpoint address of: +
[source,oac_no_warn]
----
http://localhost:8000/google/GoogleSearch
----
Note that the first portion of the URI (`google`) should not conflict
with the context root of any deployed web application. +
[source,oac_no_warn]
----
<enterprise-beans>
    <module-name>ejb.jar</module-name>
    <ejb>
      <ejb-name>GoogleEjb</ejb-name>
      <webservice-endpoint>
        <port-component-name>GoogleSearchPort</port-component-name>
        <endpoint-address-uri>google/GoogleSearch</endpoint-address-uri>
      </webservice-endpoint>
    </ejb>
</enterprise-beans>
----
* Servlet Example: +
For servlet endpoints, the `endpoint-address-uri` is only needed if the
servlet does not have a servlet-mapping `url-pattern` in its `web.xml`.
Its value is relative to the context root of the servlet's web
application. +
[source,oac_no_warn]
----
<web>
    <module-name>web.war</module-name>
    <context-root>GoogleServletContext</context-root>
    <servlet>
        <servlet-name>MyGoogleServlet</servlet-name>

           <port-component-name>GoogleSearchPort</port-component-name>
           <endpoint-address-uri>/GoogleSearch</endpoint-address-uri>
         </webservice-endpoint>
    </servlet>
</web>
----
In this case, the target endpoint address would be: +
[source,oac_no_warn]
----
http://localhost:8000/GoogleServletContext/GoogleSearch
----

[[GEYLR]][[ejb-endpoint-security]]

5.4.22.2.2 EJB Endpoint Security

[source,oac_no_warn]
----
element : login-config
----

This only applies to EJB endpoints and is optional. It is used to
specify how authentication is performed for EJB endpoint invocations. It
consists of a single subelement named `auth-method`. `auth-method` is
set to `BASIC` or `CLIENT_CERT`. The equivalent security for servlet
endpoints is set through the standard web-application security elements.
For example:

[source,oac_no_warn]
----
<ejb>
      <ejb-name>GoogleEjb</ejb-name>
      <webservice-endpoint>
        <port-component-name>GoogleSearchPort</port-component-name>
        <endpoint-address-uri>google/GoogleSearch</endpoint-address-uri>

        <login-config>
           <auth-method>BASIC</auth-method>
        </login-config>
      </webservice-endpoint>
</ejb>
----

[[GEYNB]][[transport-guarantee]]

5.4.22.2.3 Transport Guarantee

[source,oac_no_warn]
----
element : transport-guarantee
----

This is an optional setting on `webservice-endpoint`. The allowable
values are `NONE`, `INTEGRAL`, and `CONFIDENTIAL`. If not specified, the
behavior is equivalent to `NONE`. The meaning of each option is the same
as is defined in the Security chapter of the Servlet Specification
(`http://jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=369`). This setting will determine the
scheme and port used to generate the final endpoint address for a web
service endpoint. For `NONE`, the scheme will be `HTTP` and port will be
the default HTTP port. For `INTEGRAL/CONFIDENTIAL`, the scheme will be
`HTTPS` and the port will be the default HTTPS port.

[[GEYMY]][[publishing-final-wsdl-during-deployment]]

5.4.22.2.4 Publishing Final WSDL During Deployment

* URL publishing: no extra information required. +
The final WSDL document for each webservice endpoint is always published
to a URL having the following syntax:

** EJB endpoints: +
[source,oac_no_warn]
----
<scheme>://<hostname>:<port>/<endpoint_address_uri>?WSDL
----

** Servlet endpoints: +
[source,oac_no_warn]
----
<scheme>://<hostname>:<port>/<context-root><url-pattern>?WSDL
----
or +
[source,oac_no_warn]
----
<scheme>://<hostname>:<port>/<context-root><endpoint_address_uri>?WSDL
----
Note that the final WSDL document returned from this URL will contain
port entries for all ports within the same service.
* File publishing: +
[source,oac_no_warn]
----
element : wsdl-publish-location
----
To have a copy of the final WSDL written to a file, set this element to
a file URL; for example: +
[source,oac_no_warn]
----
<enterprise-beans>
    <module-name>ejb.jar</module-name>
    <webservice-description>
        <webservice-description-name>GoogleSearchService
        </webservice-description-name>
        <wsdl-publish-location>file:/home/user1/GoogleSearch_final.wsdl
        </wsdl-publish-location>
    </webservice-description>
</enterprise-beans>
----

[[GEYLF]][[webservice-client-wsdl-elements]]

5.4.22.3 Webservice Client WSDL Elements
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

In the CTS for file publishing, the directory in which to publish the
file WSDL is specified in the `<wsdl-publish-location>` tag for the
webservice, and the full path of the WSDL file is specified in the
`<wsdl-override>` tag in the client; for example:

[source,oac_no_warn]
----
<wsdl-publish-location>file:/files/wsdls/FileNested1</wsdl-publish-location>
<wsdl-override>file:/files/wsdls/FileNested1/nestedimportwsdl.wsdl</wsdl-override>
----

The Java Platform, Enterprise Edition implementation defines the
behavior this way because, for `wsdl-publish-location`, the App Server
is potentially publishing many documents, not just one. This is because
the main WSDL could have dependencies on relative imports. There is no
requirement that the initial WSDL be located at the top of the
hierarchy, even though that is commonly the case.

For example, in an ejb-jar with a Main.wsdl that imports a relative WSDL
at `../../Relative.wsdl`, the packaging would look like:

[source,oac_no_warn]
----
META-INF/wsdl/a/b/Main.wsdl
META-INF/wsdl/Relative.wsdl
----

The `wsdl-publish-location` tells the CTS where to locate the topmost
part of the WSDL content hierarchy. So, given a `wsdl-publish-location`
of `/home/foo/wsdlpublishdir`, this location would look like:

[source,oac_no_warn]
----
/home/foo/wsdlpublishdir/Relative.wsdl
/home/foo/wsdlpublishdir/a/b/Main.wsdl
----

The `wsdl-override` property still always points to a specific WSDL
document, which in this case would be
`/home/foo/wsdlpublishdir/a/b/Main.wsdl`.

[[GEYLV]][[resolving-container-managed-ports]]

5.4.22.3.1 Resolving Container-Managed Ports

[source,oac_no_warn]

----

Used to resolve the port to which a `service-ref` Service Endpoint
Interface is mapped. Only required for each `port-component-ref` in the
`service-ref` that does not have a `port-component-link`. For example:

[source,oac_no_warn]

1.  Set the following properties in the ts.jte file: +

[NOTE]
=======================================================================

An LDAP server is required in Security API testing. You could either use
an already existing external LDAP server or use CTS script to install an
internal LDAP server.

=======================================================================

Choose one of these two options to make an LDAP server ready for
testing:
1.  Use internal LDAP server - Unbounded (Recommended, and would be
installed by default.) +

[NOTE]
=======================================================================

1.  Ensure the ldap.server property is unbounded.
2.  Ensure the path of ldap.ldif.file is correct.
3.  Ensure the port 11389 is not occupied. Kill any related process
using port 11389.

[NOTE]
=========================================

Parts of ts.jte:

* ldap.server=unboundid
* ldap.install.server=true
* ldap.ldif.file=$\{ts.home}/bin/ldap.ldif

=========================================

2.  Use external LDAP server. +

[NOTE]
=======================================================================

1.  Ensure the port of LDAP server is 11389.
2.  Update ldap.install.server property as false since CTS script need
not install LDAP server.
3.  Import ldap.ldif file into Ldap server. You can get ldap.ldif from
<TS_HOME>/install/j2ee/bin/ldap.ldif.

=======================================================================


[NOTE]
=========================================

Part of ts.jte - ldap.install.server=false

=========================================

2.  Configure the VI environment using these commands to run the
Security API test (including Derby, internal Ldap server which are
required by JSR375):
1.  cd <TS_HOME>/bin
2.  ant config.vi
3.  Start your database.
4.  ant init.ldap +

[[GEXPU]][[jaxr-test-setup]]

5.4.27 JAXR Test Setup
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

You will need a Registry to run the JAXR tests. The Java Web Services
Developers Pack 1.3 contains an implementation of a UDDI version 2
business registry. You can find the Java Web Services Developers Pack at
`http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javasebusiness/downloads/java-archive-downloads-jwsdp-419428.html`.
Refer to the installation instructions that accompany the webservices
software for additional information.

The JAXR test suite assumes you are using an internal registry (inside a
firewall). If you want to use a public registry outside a firewall, you
will need to make some updates to the `ts.jte` file in the
`testExecuteAppClient` section to set up proxy information.

The above settings cover the appclient portion of the testing. You will
also need to update the proxy information for the server. For the RI,
you will need to add this to the `jvm-options` in the `domain.xml` file.
You can also use the CTS `config.vi` script to update `domain.xml`
instead of directly editing it. To use the `config.vi` script, add the
proxy to `s1as.jvm.options` in the `ts.jte` file:

* `authenticationMethod`: Authentication method for the JAXR provider;
UDDI_GET_AUTHTOKEN is the AuthToken protocol defined by [UDDI_API2]
* `registryURL`: Standard connection property for publishing. for the
RegistryServer, the UDDI Registry that comes with the Java Web Services
Developers Pack: `registryURL = http://localhost:8080/RegistryServer/`
* `queryManagerURL`: Standard connection property for querying. for the
RegistryServer, the UDDI Registry that comes with the Java Web Services
Developers Pack:
`queryManagerURL = http://localhost:8080/RegistryServer/`
* `jaxrPassword`: Used for setting connection credentials; this must be
set up in the UDDI registry
* `jaxrUser`: Used for setting connection credentials; this must be set
up in the UDDI registry
* `jaxrUser2`, `jaxrPassword2`: Second account for Association tests +
For the `RegistryServer` you can use the predefined username and
passwords. These would be set as follows:

** `jaxrUser=testuser`

** `jaxrPassword=testuser`

** `jaxrUser2=jaxr-sqe`

** `jaxrPassword2=jaxrsqe` +
If using digital certificates set to `= ""` instead.
* `jaxrSecurityCredentialType`: Tells CTS whether to use
username/password or digital certificates for JAXR credentials:

** `0`: Username/password

** `1`: Digital certificates
* `jaxrAlias`: Identifies the entry in the keystore for this user.
* `jaxrAlias2`: Identifies the entry in the keystore for the second user
* `jaxrAliasPassword`: Identifies the password in the keystore for this
user.
* `jaxrAlias2Password`: Identifies the password in the keystore for the
second user
* `jaxrWebContext`: Context root for jaxr html tests pages
* `jaxrConnectionFactoryLookup`: Preferred way for a client to lookup a
JAXR ConnectionFactory is to use JNDI; an alternate method is to use the
`newInstance` static method on the `ConnectionFactory`

** `0` = use JNDI lookup

** `1` = use `newInstance` method.
* `jaxrJNDIResource`: JAXR `ConnectionFactoryReference` if JNDI lookup
is being used; for example `java:comp/env/eis/JAXR`; if not using JNDI
lookup set to `""`.
* `providerCapabilityLevel`: Provider must set this to the supported
capability level `0` or `1`

5.5 Using the JavaTest Harness Configuration GUI
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can use the JavaTest harness GUI to modify general test settings and
to quickly get started with the default CTS test environment. After
familiarizing yourself with these basic configuration settings, you will
probably want to continue with the instructions in link:#GEXPP[Modifying
Environment Settings for Specific Technology Tests].

[[GEYNM]][[basic-configuration-overview]]

5.5.1 Basic Configuration Overview
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

In order for the JavaTest harness to execute the test suite, it requires
information about how your computing environment is configured.

The JavaTest harness requires two types of configuration information:

* Test environment: This is data used by the tests. For example, the
path to the Java runtime, how to start the product being tested, network
resources, and other information required by the tests in order to run.
This information does not change frequently and usually stays constant
from test run to test run.
* Test parameters: This is information used by the JavaTest harness to
run the tests. Test parameters are values used by the JavaTest harness
that determine which tests in the test suite are run, how the tests
should be run, and where the test reports are stored. This information
often changes from test run to test run.

When you execute the JavaTest harness software for the first time, the
JavaTest harness displays a Welcome dialog box that guides you through
the initial startup configuration.

* If it is able to open a test suite, the JavaTest harness displays a
Welcome to JavaTest dialog box that guides you through the process of
either opening an existing work directory or creating a new work
directory as described in the JavaTest online help.
* If the JavaTest harness is unable to open a test suite, it displays a
Welcome to JavaTest dialog box that guides you through the process of
opening both a test suite and a work directory as described in the
JavaTest documentation.

Once the JavaTest harness GUI is displayed, whenever you choose Run
Tests and then Start to begin a test run, the JavaTest harness
determines whether all of the required configuration information has
been supplied:

* If the test environment and parameters have been completely
configured, the test run starts immediately.
* If any required configuration information is missing, the
configuration editor displays a series of questions asking you the
necessary information. This is called the configuration interview. When
you have entered the configuration data, you are asked if you wish to
proceed with running the test.

5.5.2 The Configuration Interview
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To configure the JavaTest harness to run the Java EE 8 CTS tests,
complete the following steps. Note that you only need to complete these
steps the first time you start the JavaTest harness. After you complete
these steps, you can either run all or a subset of the tests, as
described in link:using.html#GBFWO[Chapter 7, "Executing Tests"].

1.  Change to the `<TS_HOME>/bin` directory and start the JavaTest test
harness: +
[source,oac_no_warn]
----
cd <TS_HOME>/bin
ant gui
----
The Welcome screen displays.
2.  Click File, then click Create Work Directory to create a new work
directory. +
If you already have a working directory you want to use, click File,
then click Open Work Directory instead. +
At this point, the JavaTest harness is preconfigured to run the basic
CTS tests.
3.  If you want to run the test suite at this time using your current
configuration settings, select Run Tests from the main menu, then select
Start. +
The default tests are executed with the default configuration settings. +
If you do not want to run the test suite at this time, continue with the
steps below to modify your test configuration.
4.  Select Configure from the main menu, then select Edit Configuration. +
The Configuration Welcome screen displays.
5.  Click Next (right arrow). +
You are prompted to specify one or more configuration files that contain
information about your test environment. By default, this file is
`<TS_HOME>/bin/ts.jte`.
6.  Accept the default configuration file and click Next. +
You are prompted to specify a test environment.
7.  Select either `ts_unix` or `ts_win32`, and then click Next. +
Choose `ts_unix` if you are running the tests in a Unix or Linux
environment; choose `ts_win32` if you are running the tests under
Windows. +
After making your selection and clicking Next, you are prompted to
specify whether you want to run all or a subset of the test suite.
8.  Specify whether you want to run all or a subset of the tests, and
then click Next. +
Select Yes to run a subset of the tests; select No to run all tests. +
If you select Yes, proceed to the next step. If you select No, skip to
Step 10.
9.  Select the tests you want to run from the displayed test tree, and
then click Next. +
You can select entire branches of the test tree, or use Ctrl+Click or
Shift+Click to select multiple tests or ranges of tests, respectively.
10. Specify whether you want to use an exclude list, and then click
Next. +
Select Yes to use an exclude list; select No to not use an exclude list. +
If you select Yes, proceed to the next step. If you select No, skip to
Step 13.
11. Specify the exclude list you want to use, and then click Next. +
Select `initial` to use the default list; select `custom` to use a
custom list. +
If you select `custom`, proceed to the next step. If you select
`initial`, skip to Step 13.
12. Specify the custom exclude list file to use, and then click Next.
13. Click Done to accept and save your configuration settings. +
You are prompted to specify the location in which you want to save your
configuration settings.
14. Specify the file in which you want to save your configuration
settings, and then click Save File. +
You are returned to the JavaTest main window.
15. If you want to run the test suite at this time using your current
configuration settings, select Run Tests from the main menu, then select
Start. +
The default tests are executed with the settings you specified.
