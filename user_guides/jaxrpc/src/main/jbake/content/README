The file attributes.conf defines several attributes (variables) that
need to be customized for each technology.

Most of the *.adoc files should not need to be modified.

The following "include" files should be customized as necessary
for the specific technology:

- rules.inc

	Additional compatibility rules needed by some technologies.
	The rules in rules.adoc should NOT be changed.

- config.inc

	Detailed instructions for configuring the TCK, included in
	Chapter 4.  Unfortunately, these are sections 4.1 - 4.3,
	so even if the TCK doesn't require 3 sections you need to
	make up something, or else renumber the subsequent sections
	and fix all the references (ugh).

- packages.inc

	A simple list of Java package names for the technology.

- tck-packages.inc

	A list of additional software pacakges included in the TCK.

- debug-tips.inc

	Technology-specific troubleshooting tips for Chapter 6.
	If this isn't needed, it can be an empty file, but toc.adoc
	will need to be fixed.

- rebuild.adoc

	Special instructions for rebuilding the war files used by some TCKs.
	If needed, customize it appropriately and make sure the "next"
	pointer in faq.adoc points to it.  Otherwise, remove the "next"
	pointer in faq.adoc and update toc.adoc.
