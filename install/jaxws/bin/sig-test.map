# IMPORTANT:  this sig-test.map file for use with JDK 5 only!
#             Using this file with a non JDK 5 will yield errors.
#
# The signature test mapping file for the JAX-WS 2.2 TCK.  This file
# should be formatted as a standard java properties file.  The
# name is the package name and the value is the version of the
# package that should be tested by the signature tests.
#
# The resultant signature file name has a name that complies
# with the following format:
# <package>.sig_<technology_version>_<JavaSE_version_these_work_with>
# Given this format, the following example breaks down as follows:
#    javax.xml.jaxws.sig_2.2_se5:
#    javax.xml.jaxws.sig_2.2_se6:
#    javax.xml.jaxws.sig_2.2_se7:
#      <package> = javax.xml.ws
#      <technology_version> = 2.2  (for JAX-WS) 
#      <JavaSE_version_these_work_with> = JDK 5, JDK 6 and JDK 7
#
# For this release valid versions are:  "_se5", "_se6", or "_se5_se6_se7"
# This sig-test.map file is designed to be run using JDK 5 so any
# signature file that has "_se5"  in its name will be valid.
# If a signature file contains other than "_se5"  in its signature name,
# than that means that signature file MUST not be referenced using JDK 5.
