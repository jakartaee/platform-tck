# IMPORTANT:  this sig-test.map file for use with JDK 9 only!
#             Using this file with other version of JDK will yield errors.
#
# The signature test mapping file for the JSON-B 1.0 TCK.  This file
# should be formatted as a standard java properties file.  The
# name is the package name and the value is the version of the
# package that should be tested by the signature tests.
#
# The resultant signature file name has a name that complies
# with the following format:
# <package>.sig_<technology_version>_<JavaSE_version_these_work_with>
# Given this format, the following example breaks down as follows:
#    javax.json.bind.sig_1.0_se8:
#    javax.json.bind.sig_1.0_se9:
#      <package> = javax.json.bind
#      <technology_version> = 1.0  (for JSON-B) 
#      <JavaSE_version_these_work_with> = se8 and se9
#
# For this release valid versions are:  "_se8", "_se9", or "_se8_se9"
# This sig-test.map file is designed to be run using JDK 9 so any
# signature file that ends with "_se9"  or "se8_se9" will be valid.
# if a signature file contains only "_se9"  and no reference to "_se8" 
# in the signature name, than that means that signature file MUST only
# be referenced when using JDK 9.
