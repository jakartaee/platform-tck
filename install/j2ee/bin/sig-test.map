# IMPORTANT:  this sig-test.map file for use with JDK 5 only!
#             Using this file with JDK 6 will yeild errors.
#
# The signature test mapping file for the JavaEE TCK.  This file
# should be formatted as a standard java properties file.  The
# name is the package name and the value is the version of the
# package that should be tested by the signature tests.
#
# The resultant signature file name has a name that complies
# with the following format:
# <package>.sig_<technology_version><JavaSE_version_these_work_with>
# Given this format, the following example breaks down as follows:
#    javax.xml.soap.sig_1.3_se5_se6:
#      <package> = javax.xml.soap
#      <technology_version> = 1.3  (for SAAJ) 
#      <JavaSE_version_these_work_with> = JDK 5 and JDK 6
#
# For this release valid versions are:  "_se5", "_se6", or "_se5_se6"
# This sig-test.map file is designed to be run using JDK 5 so any
# signature file that ends with "_se5"  or "se5_se6" will be valid.
# if a signature file contains only "_se6"  and no reference to "_se5" 
# in the signature name, that that means that signature file MUST only
# be referenced when using JDK 6.  
#
# For updates to this file when the JavaEE spec gets updated,
# as a good rule of thumb, we pull out any packages that end
# up as being included with the J2SE. So if any of the packages
# listed below ends up being incorporated into J2SE in the future, 
# that will be a hint that those packages can likely be removed 
# from this sig-test.map file. 
#

#
# Note: Recording the signatures of a package includes all
#       child packages.  The signature test tool looks for
#       the best signature file to use when playing back
#       signatures.  Meaning if we have a javax.servlet
#       signature file and a javax.servlet.jsp signature file,
#       the signature test tool will use the javax.servlet.jsp
#       signature file to verify the javax.servlet.jsp package
#       signatures even though the javax.servlet signature
#       file contains the javax.servlet.jsp package signatures.
#       The signatures are in both files (since the API Check
#       tool records child package signatures and there does
#       not seem to be a way to turn this feature off) but the
#       javax.servlet.jsp signature file can vary independent
#       of the javax.servlet signature file.
#
# Command used to record the JavaEE signatures in reflective mode

#   -Dsig.source=/sun/appserver8/lib/javaee.jar \
#   -Dmap.file=/home/ryano/spider-new/bin/sig-test.map \
