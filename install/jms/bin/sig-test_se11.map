# IMPORTANT:  This sig-test.map file for use with JDK 11 only!
#
# The signature test mapping file for the JMS 3.0 TCK.  This file
# should be formatted as a standard java properties file.  The
# name is the package name and the value is the version of the
# package that should be tested by the signature tests.
#
# The resultant signature file name has a name that complies
# with the following format:
# <package>.sig_<technology_version><JavaSE_version_these_work_with>
# Given this format, the following example breaks down as follows:
#    jakarta.jms.sig_3.0_se11:
#      <package> = jakarta.jms
#      <technology_version> = 3.0  (for JMS) 
#      <JavaSE_version_these_work_with> = JDK 11 and above
#
# For this release valid versions are:  "_se11".
