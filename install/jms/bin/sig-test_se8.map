# IMPORTANT:  This sig-test.map file for use with JDK 8 only!
#             JMS 2.0 is supported on JDK 8 and above!
#
# The signature test mapping file for the JMS 2.0 TCK.  This file
# should be formatted as a standard java properties file.  The
# name is the package name and the value is the version of the
# package that should be tested by the signature tests.
#
# The resultant signature file name has a name that complies
# with the following format:
# <package>.sig_<technology_version><JavaSE_version_these_work_with>
# Given this format, the following example breaks down as follows:
#    jakarta.jms.sig_2.0_se8:
#      <package> = jakarta.jms
#      <technology_version> = 2.0  (for JMS) 
#      <JavaSE_version_these_work_with> = JDK 8 and above
#
# For this release valid versions are:  "_se8".
