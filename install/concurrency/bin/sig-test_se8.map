# IMPORTANT:  this sig-test.map file for use with JDK 8 only!
#
# The signature test mapping file for the CONCURRENCY 1.0 TCK.
# This file should be formatted as a standard java properties file.
# The name is the package name and the value is the version of the
# package that should be tested by the signature tests.
#
# The resultant signature file name has a name that complies
# with the following format:
# <package>.sig_<technology_version>_<JavaSE_version_these_work_with>
# Given this format, the following example breaks down as follows:
#    jakarta.enterprise.concurrent.sig_1.0_se8:
#      <package> = jakarta.enterprise.concurrent
#      <technology_version> = 1.0  (for CONCURRENCY)
#      <JavaSE_version_these_work_with> = se8
#
# This sig-test.map file is designed to be run using JDK 8 only.
