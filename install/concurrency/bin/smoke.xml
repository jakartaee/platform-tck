        These are the smoke tests for the JAX-WS 2.2 TCK. This is a 
        subset of tests in the TCK and is meant to provide a variety of
        test coverage without the need for the entire TCK. It is by no
        means meant to be a substitute for the entire TCK and a user is
        required to run the entire TCK to verify compatibility.
