--------------------------

Container Managed Transaction tests for a single table.

Specification assertion under test: 
	Section 17.3.4 Enterprise beans using bean-managed transactions
	Section 17.6.1 Bean-managed transactions

The assertion:
The Container invokes an EJB method whose transaction attribute is set
to Supports as follows:

	A stateless session instance must commit all transactions,
	local and global, before a business method returns

	If a statless session instance starts a transaction in a business
	method, it must commit the transaction before the business method
	returns (this applies to both global and local transactions).

17.6.2.6 If the client calls with a transaction context, the Container
throws the java.rmi.RemoteException.

Test Case(s):
These tests ensure that the Container provides the transaction
demarcation for the EJBs which are declared as using container
managed demarcation.

Single table/single connection cases include:
	Perform Insert/Delete operations to a single table and ensure
	that these operations are commited automatically after each
	method completes.

The test itself is made up of:
1 Client
1 TestTean, this bean:
	o	drives the tests and is TX_BEAN_MANAGED 
	o	acts as a client to the JDBC transactional bean (TxBean).
1 TxBean, this bean:
	o	is the JDBC transactional bean and is called by TestBean.
