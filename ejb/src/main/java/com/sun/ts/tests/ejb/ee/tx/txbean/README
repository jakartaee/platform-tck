The TxBean represents an EJB which contains all of the
business methods for interacting with a JDBC RDBMS.

The TxBean is used by many of the compatibility tests
such as a standard library would be used.

Specifically, the TxBean is used with the Transactional
compatibility tests.

The TxBean is deployed with all the required bean flavors:
ejb0.JNDIName=ejb.ee.tx.txbean.TxBeanManaged
ejb1.JNDIName=ejb.ee.tx.txbean.TxNotSupported
ejb2.JNDIName=ejb.ee.tx.txbean.TxSupports
ejb3.JNDIName=ejb.ee.tx.txbean.TxRequired
ejb4.JNDIName=ejb.ee.tx.txbean.TxRequiresNew
ejb5.JNDIName=ejb.ee.tx.txbean.TxMandatory
ejb6.JNDIName=ejb.ee.tx.txbean.TxNever

This allows all of the Transactional requirements to be
fully tested.
