Handling of exceptions thrown by a business method
of an EJB with Bean-Managed transactions.

Specification assertion under test: 
	18.3	Container Provider responsibilities.
	18.3.1	Exceptions from EJB's business methods

The assertion:
The handling of exceptions thrown by a business method of a session
with bean-managed transaction, for statful or stateless Session EJBs
is as follows:

Application Exceptions:
	Container's action:
	o	Re-throw the AppException.
	Client's view:
	o	Recieves AppException.

All other exceptions:
	Container's action:
	o	Log the exception or error.
	o	Mark for rollback a global or local transaction that
		has been started, but not yet completed, by the instance
	o	Discard instance.
	o	Throw RemoteException.
	Client's view:
	o	Receives a RemoteException.

Test Case(s):
Check that the Container and the Client do what is required of them in
the following conditions:
o	AppException from EJB.
o	SystemException from EJB.
o	Vanilla RemoteExcetion from EJB.
o	EJBException from EJB.
o	Error from EJB.
	
The test itself is made up of:
1 Client
1 TestTean, this bean:
	o	drives the tests and is TX_BEAN_MANAGED 
	o	acts as a client to the JDBC transactional bean (TxBean).
1 TxBean, this bean:
	o	is the JDBC transactional bean and is called by TestBean.
