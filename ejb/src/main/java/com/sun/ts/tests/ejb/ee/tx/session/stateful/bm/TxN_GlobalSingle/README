Bean Managed Global Transaction tests for a single table.

Specification assertion under test: 
	17.3.2	 Local vs. global transaction 
        17.6.2.6 Container Managed Transactions - Never

17.3.2 An enterprise bean using bean-managed transaction demarcates global
transactions by using the jakarta.transaction.UserTransaction
interface. 

All updates to the resource managers between the
UserTransaction.begin() and UserTransaction.commit() methods are
performed in a global transaction.

17.6.2.6 If the client calls with a transaction context, the Container
throws the java.rmi.RemoteException.

Test Case(s):

Single table/single connection cases include:
o       Test that accessing a business method of a TX_NEVER EJB
	throws java.rmi.RemoteException to the client.

The test itself is made up of:
1 Client
1 TestTean, this bean:
        o       drives the tests and is TX_BEAN_MANAGED 
                (gets the UserTransaction) interface.
        o       acts as a client to the JDBC transactional bean (TxBean).
1 TxBean, this bean:
        o       is the JDBC transactional bean and is called by TestBean.
