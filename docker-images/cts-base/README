This directory contains the Dockerfiles used for creating images used to run the TCK tests in the Eclipse CI using Jenkins pipeline.
-Use eclipse bugzilla (https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs) to avail write permissions on any repositories in these docker hub organizations
-If the images are required to be updated, create new tags(versions) of the same docker image ; it is possible to overwrite the existing image:version but not recommended.
-If the docker image is updated with another version the same has to be updated in Jenkinsfile to use them in the CI runs.
