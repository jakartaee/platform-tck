---------
Overview:
---------
This directory contains the signature files necessary to create any deliverable
generated from the jakartaee-tck repository.  Most deliverables will only include
a subset of the signature files stored in this directory.



------------------------
Sig File Naming Schemes:
------------------------
The signature files have the following naming scheme:
	<package_name>.sig
Where <package_name> is the name of the package who's signatures are in this
file, note this includes all sub-packages.  

----------------------------------
Which Sig Files Apply To Your TCK:
----------------------------------
All TCKs which contain public API's need to perform signature test verifications.
The names of the signature files used by a TCK is called out in the 
$TS_HOME/bin/sig-test.map file.  The sig-test.map file contains key-value pairs
where the key=package_name and value=version_id.
