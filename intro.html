<p>This chapter provides an overview of the principles that apply
generally to all Technology Compatibility Kits (TCKs) and describes the
Jakarta Expression Language TCK (Expression Language 5.0 TCK).
It also includes a high level listing
of what is needed to get up and running with the Expression Language
TCK.</p>

<h3 id="_1_1_compatibility_testing">1.1 Compatibility Testing</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Compatibility testing differs from traditional product testing in a
number of ways. The focus of compatibility testing is to test those
features and areas of an implementation that are likely to differ across
other implementations, such as those features that:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Rely on hardware or operating system-specific behavior</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Are difficult to port</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Mask or abstract hardware or operating system behavior</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Compatibility test development for a given feature relies on a complete
specification and compatible implementation (CI) for that feature.
Compatibility testing is not primarily concerned with robustness,
performance, nor ease of use.</p>

<h4 id="_1_1_1_why_compatibility_testing_is_important">1.1.1 Why Compatibility Testing is Important</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Jakarta platform compatibility is important to different groups involved
with Jakarta technologies for different reasons:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Compatibility testing ensures that the Jakarta platform does not become
fragmented as it is ported to different operating systems and hardware
environments.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Compatibility testing benefits developers working in the Jakarta
programming language, allowing them to write applications once and then
to deploy them across heterogeneous computing environments without
porting.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Compatibility testing allows application users to obtain applications
from disparate sources and deploy them with confidence.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Conformance testing benefits Jakarta platform implementors by ensuring a
level playing field for all Jakarta platform ports.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>Compatibility criteria for all technology implementations are embodied
in the TCK Compatibility Rules that apply to a specified technology.
Each TCK tests for adherence to these Rules as described in
<a href="rules.html#GBFSN">Chapter 2, "Procedure for Certification."</a></p>

<h4 id="_1_1_3_tck_overview">1.1.3 TCK Overview</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A TCK is a set of tools and tests used to verify that a vendor&#8217;s compatible
implementation of a Jakarta EE technology conforms to the applicable
specification. All tests in the TCK are based on the written
specifications for the Jakarta EE platform. A TCK tests compatibility of a
vendor&#8217;s compatible implementation of the technology to the applicable
specification of the technology. Compatibility testing is a means of
ensuring correctness, completeness, and consistency across all
implementations developed by technology licensees.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The set of tests included with each TCK is called the test suite. Most
tests in a TCK&#8217;s test suite are self-checking, but some tests may
require tester interaction. Most tests return either a Pass or Fail
status. For a given platform to be certified, all of the required tests
must pass. The definition of required tests may change from platform to
platform.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The definition of required tests will change over time. Before your
final certification test pass, be sure to download the latest version
of this TCK.</p>

<p>The Jakarta EE Specification Process (JESP) program is the formalization of the
open process that has been used since 2019 to develop and revise Jakarta EE
technology specifications in cooperation with the international Jakarta EE
community. The JESP program specifies that the following three major
components must be included as deliverables in a final Jakarta EE technology
release under the direction of the responsible Expert Group:</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>The JavaTest harness version 5.0 is a set of tools
designed to run and manage test suites on different Java platforms.
To JavaTest, Jakarta EE can be considered another platform.
The JavaTest harness can be described as both a Java application and a set
of compatibility testing tools. It can run tests on different kinds of
Java platforms and it allows the results to be browsed online within
the JavaTest GUI, or offline in the HTML reports that the JavaTest
harness generates.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The JavaTest harness includes the applications and tools that are used
for test execution and test suite management. It supports the following
features:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Sequencing of tests, allowing them to be loaded and executed automatically</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Graphic user interface (GUI) for ease of use</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Automated reporting capability to minimize manual errors</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Failure analysis</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Test result auditing and auditable test specification framework</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Distributed testing environment support</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>To run tests using the JavaTest harness, you specify which tests in the
test suite to run, how to run them, and where to put the results as
described in <a href="config.html#GBFVV">Chapter 4, "Setup and
Configuration."</a></p>

<h4 id="_1_2_4_tck_compatibility_test_suite">1.2.4 TCK Compatibility Test Suite</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The test suite is the collection of tests used by the JavaTest harness
to test a particular technology implementation. In this case, it is the
collection of tests used by the Expression Language TCK
5.0 to test a Expression Language 5.0
implementation. The tests are designed to verify that a vendor&#8217;s
runtime implementation of the technology complies with the appropriate
specification. The individual tests correspond to assertions of the
specification.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The tests that make up the TCK compatibility test suite are precompiled
and indexed within the TCK test directory structure. When a test run is
started, the JavaTest harness scans through the set of tests that are
located under the directories that have been selected. While scanning,
the JavaTest harness selects the appropriate tests according to any
matches with the filters you are using and queues them up for execution.</p>

<h4 id="_1_2_5_exclude_lists">1.2.5 Exclude Lists</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Each version of a TCK includes an Exclude List contained in a <code>.jtx</code>
file.
This is a list of test file URLs that identify tests which do not
have to be run for the specific version of the TCK being used.
Whenever tests are run, the JavaTest harness automatically excludes
any test on the Exclude List from being executed.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A vendor&#8217;s compatible implementation is not required to pass or run any test on the Exclude List.
The Exclude List file, <code>&lt;TS_HOME&gt;/bin/ts.jtx</code>, is included in the
Expression Language TCK.</p>

<p>From time to time, updates to the Exclude List are made available.
The exclude list is included in the Jakarta TCK ZIP archive.
Each time an update is approved and released, the version number
will be incremented.
You should always make sure you are using an up-to-date copy of the
Exclude List before running the Expression Language TCK to verify your
implementation.</p>
</div>

</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A test might be in the Exclude List for reasons such as:</p>

<li>
<p>An error in an underlying implementation API has been discovered which
does not allow the test to execute properly.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>An error in the specification that was used as the basis of the test
has been discovered.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>An error in the test itself has been discovered.</p>

<li>
<p>The test fails due to a bug in the tools (such as the JavaTest
harness, for example).</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In addition, all tests are run against the compatible implementations.
Any tests that fail when run on a compatible Jakarta platform are put on the
Exclude List. Any test that is not specification-based, or for which the
specification is vague, may be excluded. Any test that is found to be
implementation dependent (based on a particular thread scheduling model,
based on a particular file system behavior, and so on) may be excluded.</p>
