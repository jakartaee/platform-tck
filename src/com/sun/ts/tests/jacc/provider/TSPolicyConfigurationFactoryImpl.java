   * the identified policy context.
   * <P>
   * If at the time of the call, the identified policy context does not exist in
   * the provider, then the policy context will be created in the provider and

   * be returned. If the state of the identified context is "deleted" or
   * "inService" it will be transitioned to the "open" state as a result of the
   * call. The states in the lifecycle of a policy context are defined by the
   * PolicyConfiguration interface.
   * <P>
   * For a given value of policy context identifier, this method must always
   * return the same instance of PolicyConfiguration and there must be at most
   * one actual instance of a PolicyConfiguration with a given policy context
   * identifier (during a process context).

   * object for a given policy context, it may be necessary for this method to
   * be thread safe.

   *          statements of an existing policy context are to be removed before
   *          its PolicyConfiguration object is returned. If the value passed to
   *          this parameter is true, the policy statements of an existing
   *          policy context will be removed. If the value is false, they will
   *          not be removed.
