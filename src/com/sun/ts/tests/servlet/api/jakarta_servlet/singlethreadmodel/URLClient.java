   * @test_Strategy: This test will use a multi-threaded client to validate that
   * SingleThreadModel servlets are handled properly. To do this, the following
   * jte property needs to be set: ServletClientThreads. This configures the
   * number of threads that the client will use.
   *
   * If a servlet implements this interface, you are guaranteed that no two
   * threads will execute concurrently in the servlet's service method.
   *
   * If the container implementation is one that doesn't pool SingleThreadModel
   * servlets, then the value can be left at the default of 2. However, if the
   * container does pool SingleThreadModel servlets, the ServletClientThreads
   * property should be set to twice the size of the instance pool. For example,
   * if the container's pool size for SingleThreadModel servlets is 10, then set
   * the ServletClientThreads property to 20.
   *
   * Also take note, that each thread will make 3 requests to the test servlet.
   * The outcome of this test for both pooled and non-pooled implementations
   * will be the same, however by configuring the threads, we can validate
   * implementations which pool these type of servlets.
