/**
 * If a Message Listener Interface(MLI) is bundled into a standalone .rar file,
 * then that MLI should be accessible to MDB's that wishes to implement it but
 * not bundle it in the ejb jar file. (Bug id 6559421)
 *
 * This MDB is a EJB3.0 based Message Driven Bean, which uses custom
 * MessageListener TSMessageListenerInterface.
 *
 * The purpose of this test is to verify, that the custom Message Listener
 * interface is not required to be packaged along with ejb jar files, since the
 * custom Message Listener interface(TSMessageListenerInterface) is already
 * availale in the resource adapter, it should be available for the MDB.
 *
 * The test client verifies that the annotated PostConstruct method is called
 * during the PostConstruct stage of the message driven bean(MDBean).
 *
 * Note: This MDB makes use of the whitebox-tx resource adapter from connector
 * test area.
