   * defied therein is invalid. The websocket implementation must not deploy
   * such an endpoint and must raise a deployment error if an attempt is made to
   * deploy such an annotated endpoint. [WSC-4.7-1]
   * 
   * If the deployment error occurs under the programmatic control of the
   * developer, for example, when using the WebSocketContainer API to deploy a
   * client endpoint, deployment errors must be reported by the container to the
