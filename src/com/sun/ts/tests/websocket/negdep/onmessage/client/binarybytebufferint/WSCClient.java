   * deployed by the container, even if they are valid.

   * Any method annotated with @OnMessage that does not conform to the forms
   * defied therein is invalid. The websocket implementation must not deploy
   * such an endpoint and must raise a deployment error if an attempt is made to
   * deploy such an annotated endpoint. [WSC-4.7-1]
   * 
   * If the deployment error occurs under the programmatic control of the
   * developer, for example, when using the WebSocketContainer API to deploy a
   * client endpoint, deployment errors must be reported by the container to the
   * developer by using an instance of the DeploymentException. [WSC-5.2.1-4]
