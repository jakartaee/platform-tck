/**
 * The Spec is a bit fuzzy about how the annotation should work. But the proper
 * meaning should be that it works the way java se states, i.e. annotation
 * inheritance from java language specification.
 * <p/>
 * <ul>
 * <li>So first if the super class has the annotation then the subclass has it,
 * too.</li>
 * <li>Second, if super class has the annotation and the subclass override the
 * method, the annotation is gone</li>
 * <li>Third, most tricky, if the annotation is on superclass not overridden in
 * subclass and annotation is put to some other method in subclass, the subclass
 * has the annotation twice, first from superclass and second from subclass and
 * the class should not deploy, i.e. DeploymentException is thrown as stated by
 * WSC-4.8.1, Section 4.8 WebSockets and Inheritance, WebSocket
 * Specification</li>
 * </ul>
 * This has proven to be incorrectly understood by various implementing teams,
 * but after several discussions, the common agreement is the java se behavior.
