# Arquillian protocols for JavaTest migration to Arquillian/Junit5

This set of modules define arquillian protocols for JavaTest migration to Arquillian/Junit5. This is a step in completing the migration of JavaTest to Arquillian/Junit5. As of EE11 there will be no dependency on JavaTest, but the vehicle framework used on top of JavaTest is still in place to minimize the impact of the migration.

Future work will be to remove the vehicle framework and migrate the tests to more standard Arquillian protocols like servlet and REST.
