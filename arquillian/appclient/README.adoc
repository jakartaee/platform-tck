= Jakarta EE 11 AppClient Protocol

This is an Arquillian protocol used by the TCK appclient vehicle tests to
run a Jakarta EE Application Client based test. The logic in the handling of
the protocol as output to the console of the appclient process is based on how
the CTS version of the Jakarta TCK in EE 10 behaves.
