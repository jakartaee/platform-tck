The security tests for both JSP and servlet performs the same functionality.

So the common code between JSP and servlet was previously kept under 

    TS_HOME/src/com/sun/ts/tests/common/jspservletsec/SecBasicClient.java
    TS_HOME/src/com/sun/ts/tests/common/jspservletsec/secformClient.java

Now they are copied to this folder to be used exclusively for JSP tests.
And they are extended and used under  

    jsp/src/main/java/com/sun/ts/tests/jsp/sec/secbasic/Client.java  (JSP)
    jsp/src/main/java/com/sun/ts/tests/jsp/sec/secform/Client.java   (JSP)
