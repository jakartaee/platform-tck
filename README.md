# Platform TCK

## Building

From the root folder, try:
```
mvn clean install -Dmaven.compiler.failOnError=false > /tmp/build.txt
```

During early phases of releases you may need to specify the staging profile to get the artifacts from the staging
repository that have not been released yet. This is done by adding the `-Pstaging` option to the maven command.
```
mvn clean install -Pstaging -Dmaven.compiler.failOnError=false > /tmp/build.txt
```

At the end of the build the tck test artifacts are installed into the local maven repository.
