    <!-- The localization context for formatting actions can
             be provided by wrapping these actions in a fmt:bundle
             action.  The Locale of the selected resource bundle
             will be used as the locale for the formatting action.
             Additionally, if the action is wrapped by the bundle action
             the jakarta.servlet.jsp.jstl.fmt.localizationContext config variable
             will not be considered. -->
